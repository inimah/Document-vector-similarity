I decide to create a brief summary of my literature review w.r.t to "Document vector similarity", which I clustered into several topic categorization.

**1. Word Embedding**

| Reference        | About           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| (author,year)      | a | 
| (author,year)      | b      |  
| (author,year) | c      |   

My review:

**2. Document/Sentence distance (sentence representation)**

Approaches

| Reference        | Keys           | Summary |
| ------------- |-------------| ------------- | 
| \[4] (Cedric, et al., 2015) | Combination of word-embedding and tf-idf weighting | - in short text similarity case, tf-idf often fails |
| 5. (Weston, et al., 2014) | Averaging word vector     |  |
| 6. (Santos & Ganti, 2014) | Averaging word vector |   |
| 7. (Collobert, et al., 2011) | Averaging word vector      |  |
