I decide to create a brief summary of my literature review w.r.t to "Document vector similarity", which I clustered into several topic categorization.

**1. Word Embedding**

| Reference        | About           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| (author,year)      | a | 
| (author,year)      | b      |  
| (author,year) | c      |

**2. Document/Sentence distance (sentence representation)**
