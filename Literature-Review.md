I decide to create a brief summary of my literature review w.r.t to "Document vector similarity", which I clustered into several topic categorization.

**1. Word Embedding**

| Reference        | About           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| (author,year)      | a | 
| (author,year)      | b      |  
| (author,year) | c      |

**2. Document/Sentence distance (sentence representation)**

| Reference        | Keys           | Summary |
| ------------- |-------------| ------------- | 
| De Boom, Cedric, et al. "Learning semantic similarity for very short texts." Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW), 2015 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2015.      | Combination of word-embedding and tf-idf weighting | - in short text similarity case, tf-idf often fails |
| (author,year)      | b      |  |
| (author,year) | c      |   |
