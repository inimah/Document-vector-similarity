# Word-vector
Experiments about word vector space representation for unsupervised learning approach of unstructured data. This includes topics in:
- text-document similarity distance
- text-document clustering
- evaluation on unsupervised word embedding


The following data are used in this study:

1. Toy Information Retrieval (IR) data
Text documents (total 24 docs) are purposefully generated for common IR-similarity distance problems.Each document consists of a single sentence that either has "dog", "cat", or "mouse" words. The purpose of this toy data sets is for analysing how word-embeddings approach(es) will perform on finding the similarity in this small set of unlabelled data that can be easily evaluated (by human feedback). 
   
2. Shakespeare plays
Shakespeare's play and poetry data sets, which are categorized into 4 categories of genres (comedy, history, tragedy, poetry). Preliminary experiments (https://github.com/sereprz/ShakespeareTextAnalysis) has investigated the word vector of similar data sets but more focusing on the analysis of specific words in topical categorization and sentiment analysis problems.   

Likewise, we want to expore how document clustering with detect interesting insights and (hopefully) useful patterns in this classification problem.


3. Newsfeed data sets


3. Dutch wikipedia embedding
