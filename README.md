# Word-vector
Experiments about word vector space representation for unsupervised learning approach of unstructured data. This includes topics in:
- text-document similarity distance
- text-document clustering
- evaluation on unsupervised word embedding


The data used in this experiments are:

1. Toy Information Retrieval (IR) data
   Text documents (total 24 docs) are purposefully generated for common IR-similarity distance problems.Each document consists of a single sentence that either has "dog", "cat", or "mouse" words. The purpose of this toy data is for analysing how the proposed approach(es) will perform on finding the similarity 
   
2. Shakespeare plays


3. Newsfeed data sets


3. Dutch wikipedia embedding
