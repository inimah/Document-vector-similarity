<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and
<BR>Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Escalus.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>My lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Of government the properties to unfold,
<BR>Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
<BR>Since I am put to know that your own science
<BR>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
<BR>My strength can give you: then no more remains,
<BR>But that to your sufficiency [           ]
<BR>[                  ] as your Worth is able,
<BR>And let them work. The nature of our people,
<BR>Our city's institutions, and the terms
<BR>For common justice, you're as pregnant in
<BR>As art and practise hath enriched any
<BR>That we remember. There is our commission,
<BR>From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
<BR>I say, bid come before us Angelo.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit an Attendant]

<tr valign=top><td><td>What figure of us think you he will bear?
<BR>For you must know, we have with special soul
<BR>Elected him our absence to supply,
<BR>Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
<BR>And given his deputation all the organs
<BR>Of our own power: what think you of it?


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>If any in Vienna be of worth
<BR>To undergo such ample grace and honour,
<BR>It is Lord Angelo.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Look where he comes.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ANGELO]


<tr valign=top><td>ANGELO
<td>Always obedient to your grace's will,
<BR>I come to know your pleasure.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Angelo,
<BR>There is a kind of character in thy life,
<BR>That to the observer doth thy history
<BR>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
<BR>Are not thine own so proper as to waste
<BR>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
<BR>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
<BR>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
<BR>Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
<BR>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
<BR>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
<BR>The smallest scruple of her excellence
<BR>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
<BR>Herself the glory of a creditor,
<BR>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
<BR>To one that can my part in him advertise;
<BR>Hold therefore, Angelo:--
<BR>In our remove be thou at full ourself;
<BR>Mortality and mercy in Vienna
<BR>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
<BR>Though first in question, is thy secondary.
<BR>Take thy commission.


<tr valign=top><td>ANGELO
<td>Now, good my lord,
<BR>Let there be some more test made of my metal,
<BR>Before so noble and so great a figure
<BR>Be stamp'd upon it.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>No more evasion:
<BR>We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
<BR>Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
<BR>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
<BR>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
<BR>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
<BR>As time and our concernings shall importune,
<BR>How it goes with us, and do look to know
<BR>What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
<BR>To the hopeful execution do I leave you
<BR>Of your commissions.


<tr valign=top><td>ANGELO
<td>Yet give leave, my lord,
<BR>That we may bring you something on the way.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>My haste may not admit it;
<BR>Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
<BR>With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
<BR>So to enforce or qualify the laws
<BR>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
<BR>I'll privily away. I love the people,
<BR>But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
<BR>Through it do well, I do not relish well
<BR>Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
<BR>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
<BR>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.


<tr valign=top><td>ANGELO
<td>The heavens give safety to your purposes!


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>I thank you. Fare you well.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
<BR>To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
<BR>To look into the bottom of my place:
<BR>A power I have, but of what strength and nature
<BR>I am not yet instructed.


<tr valign=top><td>ANGELO
<td>'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
<BR>And we may soon our satisfaction have
<BR>Touching that point.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>I'll wait upon your honour.

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO

<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
<BR>Hungary's!


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Amen.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that

<BR>one out of the table.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>'Thou shalt not steal'?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Ay, that he razed.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
<BR>all the rest from their functions: they put forth
<BR>to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
<BR>the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
<BR>well that prays for peace.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I never heard any soldier dislike it.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
<BR>grace was said.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>No? a dozen times at least.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>What, in metre?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>In any proportion or in any language.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>I think, or in any religion.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
<BR>controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
<BR>wicked villain, despite of all grace.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I grant; as there may between the lists and the
<BR>velvet. Thou art the list.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
<BR>a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
<BR>be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
<BR>art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
<BR>feelingly now?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
<BR>feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
<BR>confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
<BR>live, forget to drink after thee.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
<BR>have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>To what, I pray?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Judge.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>To three thousand dolours a year.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Ay, and more.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>A French crown more.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
<BR>art full of error; I am sound.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
<BR>things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
<BR>impiety has made a feast of thee.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE]


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
<BR>to prison was worth five thousand of you all.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Who's that, I pray thee?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
<BR>him carried away; and, which is more, within these
<BR>three days his head to be chopped off.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
<BR>Art thou sure of this?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
<BR>Julietta with child.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
<BR>hours since, and he was ever precise in
<BR>promise-keeping.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
<BR>speech we had to such a purpose.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen]


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
<BR>with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
<BR>custom-shrunk.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter POMPEY]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now! what's the news with you?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Yonder man is carried to prison.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>Well; what has he done?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>A woman.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>But what's his offence?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>What, is there a maid with child by him?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
<BR>not heard of the proclamation, have you?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>What proclamation, man?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>And what shall become of those in the city?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
<BR>but that a wise burgher put in for them.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
<BR>pulled down?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>To the ground, mistress.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
<BR>What shall become of me?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
<BR>clients: though you change your place, you need not
<BR>change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
<BR>Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
<BR>have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
<BR>will be considered.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
<BR>prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers]


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
<BR>Bear me to prison, where I am committed.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>I do it not in evil disposition,
<BR>But from Lord Angelo by special charge.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Thus can the demigod Authority
<BR>Make us pay down for our offence by weight
<BR>The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
<BR>On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen]


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
<BR>As surfeit is the father of much fast,
<BR>So every scope by the immoderate use
<BR>Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
<BR>Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
<BR>A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
<BR>send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
<BR>the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
<BR>as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
<BR>offence, Claudio?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>What but to speak of would offend again.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>What, is't murder?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>No.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Lechery?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Call it so.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>Away, sir! you must go.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
<BR>Is lechery so look'd after?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
<BR>I got possession of Julietta's bed:
<BR>You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
<BR>Save that we do the denunciation lack
<BR>Of outward order: this we came not to,
<BR>Only for propagation of a dower
<BR>Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
<BR>From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
<BR>Till time had made them for us. But it chances
<BR>The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
<BR>With character too gross is writ on Juliet.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>With child, perhaps?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Unhappily, even so.
<BR>And the new deputy now for the duke--
<BR>Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
<BR>Or whether that the body public be
<BR>A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
<BR>Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
<BR>He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
<BR>Whether the tyranny be in his place,
<BR>Or in his emmence that fills it up,
<BR>I stagger in:--but this new governor
<BR>Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
<BR>Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
<BR>So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
<BR>And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
<BR>Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
<BR>Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
<BR>thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
<BR>may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
<BR>him.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I have done so, but he's not to be found.
<BR>I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
<BR>This day my sister should the cloister enter
<BR>And there receive her approbation:
<BR>Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
<BR>Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
<BR>To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
<BR>I have great hope in that; for in her youth
<BR>There is a prone and speechless dialect,
<BR>Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
<BR>When she will play with reason and discourse,
<BR>And well she can persuade.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
<BR>like, which else would stand under grievous
<BR>imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
<BR>would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
<BR>game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>No, holy father; throw away that thought;
<BR>Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
<BR>Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
<BR>To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
<BR>More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
<BR>Of burning youth.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR THOMAS
<td>May your grace speak of it?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>My holy sir, none better knows than you
<BR>How I have ever loved the life removed
<BR>And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
<BR>Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
<BR>I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
<BR>A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
<BR>My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
<BR>And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
<BR>For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
<BR>And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
<BR>You will demand of me why I do this?


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR THOMAS
<td>Gladly, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
<BR>The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
<BR>Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
<BR>Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
<BR>That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
<BR>Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
<BR>Only to stick it in their children's sight
<BR>For terror, not to use, in time the rod
<BR>Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
<BR>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
<BR>And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
<BR>The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
<BR>Goes all decorum.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR THOMAS
<td>It rested in your grace
<BR>To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
<BR>And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
<BR>Than in Lord Angelo.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>I do fear, too dreadful:
<BR>Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
<BR>'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
<BR>For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
<BR>When evil deeds have their permissive pass
<BR>And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
<BR>I have on Angelo imposed the office;
<BR>Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
<BR>And yet my nature never in the fight
<BR>To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
<BR>I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
<BR>Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
<BR>Supply me with the habit and instruct me
<BR>How I may formally in person bear me
<BR>Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
<BR>At our more leisure shall I render you;
<BR>Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
<BR>Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
<BR>That his blood flows, or that his appetite

<BR>I am that Isabella and his sister.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
<BR>Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Woe me! for what?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>For that which, if myself might be his judge,
<BR>He should receive his punishment in thanks:
<BR>He hath got his friend with child.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Sir, make me not your story.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>It is true.
<BR>I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
<BR>With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
<BR>Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
<BR>I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
<BR>By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
<BR>And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
<BR>As with a saint.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
<BR>Your brother and his lover have embraced:
<BR>As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
<BR>That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
<BR>To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
<BR>Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Is she your cousin?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
<BR>By vain though apt affection.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>She it is.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>O, let him marry her.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>This is the point.
<BR>The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
<BR>Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
<BR>In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
<BR>By those that know the very nerves of state,
<BR>His givings-out were of an infinite distance
<BR>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
<BR>And with full line of his authority,
<BR>Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
<BR>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
<BR>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
<BR>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
<BR>With profits of the mind, study and fast.
<BR>He--to give fear to use and liberty,
<BR>Which have for long run by the hideous law,
<BR>As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
<BR>Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
<BR>Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
<BR>And follows close the rigour of the statute,
<BR>To make him an example. All hope is gone,
<BR>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
<BR>To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
<BR>'Twixt you and your poor brother.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Doth he so seek his life?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Has censured him
<BR>Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
<BR>A warrant for his execution.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Alas! what poor ability's in me
<BR>To do him good?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Assay the power you have.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>My power? Alas, I doubt--


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Our doubts are traitors
<BR>And make us lose the good we oft might win
<BR>By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
<BR>And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
<BR>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
<BR>All their petitions are as freely theirs
<BR>As they themselves would owe them.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>I'll see what I can do.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>But speedily.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>I will about it straight;
<BR>No longer staying but to give the mother
<BR>Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
<BR>Commend me to my brother: soon at night
<BR>I'll send him certain word of my success.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I take my leave of you.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Good sir, adieu.

<BR>That, in the working of your own affections,
<BR>Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
<BR>Or that the resolute acting of your blood
<BR>Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,

<BR>Err'd in this point which now you censure him,

<BR>Another thing to fall. I not deny,

<BR>That justice seizes: what know the laws
<BR>That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
<BR>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
<BR>Because we see it; but what we do not see
<BR>We tread upon, and never think of it.
<BR>You may not so extenuate his offence
<BR>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
<BR>When I, that censure him, do so offend,
<BR>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,

<BR>prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
<BR>Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the

<BR>your honour.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?


<tr valign=top><td>ELBOW
<td>First, an it like you, the house is a respected
<BR>house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
<BR>mistress is a respected woman.


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
<BR>person than any of us all.


<tr valign=top><td>ELBOW
<td>Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the

<BR>with man, woman, or child.


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS

<tr valign=top><td>ELBOW
<td>O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
<BR>Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
<BR>to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
<BR>with me, let not your worship think me the poor

<td>Hath she had any more than one husband?


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS

<td>Bum, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;

<BR>not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>If the law would allow it, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall

<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>No, Pompey.


<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY
<td>Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.

<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:

<BR>after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this

<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your

<BR>no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
<BR>I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd

<tr valign=top><td>ELBOW
<td>Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they

<tr valign=top><td>ANGELO
<td>Why do you put these sayings upon me?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA

<BR>That's like my brother's fault: if it confess

<BR>Could fetch your brother from the manacles

<tr valign=top><td>Provost

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Provost, a word with you.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>As many as you please.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost]


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Now, sister, what's the comfort?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Why,
<BR>As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
<BR>Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
<BR>Intends you for his swift ambassador,
<BR>Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
<BR>Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
<BR>To-morrow you set on.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Is there no remedy?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
<BR>To cleave a heart in twain.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>But is there any?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Yes, brother, you may live:
<BR>There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
<BR>If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
<BR>But fetter you till death.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Perpetual durance?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
<BR>Though all the world's vastidity you had,
<BR>To a determined scope.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>But in what nature?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>In such a one as, you consenting to't,
<BR>Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
<BR>And leave you naked.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Let me know the point.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
<BR>Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
<BR>And six or seven winters more respect
<BR>Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
<BR>The sense of death is most in apprehension;
<BR>And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
<BR>In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
<BR>As when a giant dies.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Why give you me this shame?
<BR>Think you I can a resolution fetch
<BR>From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
<BR>I will encounter darkness as a bride,
<BR>And hug it in mine arms.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>There spake my brother; there my father's grave
<BR>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
<BR>Thou art too noble to conserve a life
<BR>In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
<BR>Whose settled visage and deliberate word
<BR>Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
<BR>As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
<BR>His filth within being cast, he would appear
<BR>A pond as deep as hell.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>The prenzie Angelo!


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
<BR>The damned'st body to invest and cover
<BR>In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
<BR>If I would yield him my virginity,
<BR>Thou mightst be freed.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>O heavens! it cannot be.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
<BR>So to offend him still. This night's the time
<BR>That I should do what I abhor to name,
<BR>Or else thou diest to-morrow.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Thou shalt not do't.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>O, were it but my life,
<BR>I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
<BR>As frankly as a pin.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Thanks, dear Isabel.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Yes. Has he affections in him,
<BR>That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
<BR>When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
<BR>Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Which is the least?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If it were damnable, he being so wise,
<BR>Why would he for the momentary trick
<BR>Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>What says my brother?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Death is a fearful thing.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>And shamed life a hateful.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
<BR>To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
<BR>This sensible warm motion to become
<BR>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
<BR>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
<BR>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
<BR>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
<BR>And blown with restless violence round about
<BR>The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
<BR>Of those that lawless and incertain thought
<BR>Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
<BR>The weariest and most loathed worldly life
<BR>That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
<BR>Can lay on nature is a paradise
<BR>To what we fear of death.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Alas, alas!


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Sweet sister, let me live:
<BR>What sin you do to save a brother's life,
<BR>Nature dispenses with the deed so far
<BR>That it becomes a virtue.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>O you beast!
<BR>O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
<BR>Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
<BR>Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
<BR>From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
<BR>Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
<BR>For such a warped slip of wilderness
<BR>Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
<BR>Die, perish! Might but my bending down
<BR>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
<BR>I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
<BR>No word to save thee.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Nay, hear me, Isabel.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>O, fie, fie, fie!
<BR>Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
<BR>Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
<BR>'Tis best thou diest quickly.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>O hear me, Isabella!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO

<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>What is your will?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
<BR>by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
<BR>would require is likewise your own benefit.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
<BR>stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Walks apart]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
<BR>and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
<BR>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
<BR>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
<BR>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
<BR>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
<BR>glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
<BR>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
<BR>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
<BR>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
<BR>your knees and make ready.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
<BR>with life that I will sue to be rid of it.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Hold you there: farewell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit CLAUDIO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Provost, a word with you!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Provost]


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>What's your will, father


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
<BR>awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
<BR>habit no loss shall touch her by my company.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>In good time.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
<BR>the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
<BR>brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
<BR>your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
<BR>fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
<BR>fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
<BR>that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
<BR>wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
<BR>substitute, and to save your brother?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
<BR>brother die by the law than my son should be
<BR>unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
<BR>deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
<BR>speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
<BR>discover his government.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
<BR>now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
<BR>trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
<BR>advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
<BR>remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
<BR>that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
<BR>lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
<BR>the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
<BR>person; and much please the absent duke, if
<BR>peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
<BR>this business.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
<BR>anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
<BR>you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
<BR>Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
<BR>to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
<BR>which time of the contract and limit of the
<BR>solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
<BR>having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
<BR>sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
<BR>poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
<BR>renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
<BR>kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
<BR>her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
<BR>combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
<BR>with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
<BR>pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
<BR>bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
<BR>wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
<BR>is washed with them, but relents not.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
<BR>from the world! What corruption in this life, that
<BR>it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
<BR>cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
<BR>you from dishonour in doing it.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>Show me how, good father.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
<BR>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
<BR>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
<BR>like an impediment in the current, made it more
<BR>violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
<BR>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
<BR>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
<BR>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
<BR>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
<BR>silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
<BR>This being granted in course,--and now follows
<BR>all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
<BR>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
<BR>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
<BR>her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
<BR>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
<BR>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
<BR>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
<BR>think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
<BR>of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
<BR>What think you of it?


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>The image of it gives me content already; and I
<BR>trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
<BR>to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
<BR>bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
<BR>presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
<BR>grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
<BR>place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
<BR>it may be quickly.


<tr valign=top><td>ISABELLA
<td>I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be

<tr valign=top><td>POMPEY

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the

<tr valign=top><td><td>What news, friar, of the duke?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>I know none. Can you tell me of any?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
<BR>some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
<BR>the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
<BR>to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
<BR>puts transgression to 't.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>He does well in 't.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
<BR>him: something too crabbed that way, friar.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
<BR>it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
<BR>it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
<BR>down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
<BR>woman after this downright way of creation: is it
<BR>true, think you?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>How should he be made, then?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
<BR>was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
<BR>certain that when he makes water his urine is
<BR>congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
<BR>motion generative; that's infallible.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
<BR>rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
<BR>man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
<BR>Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
<BR>hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
<BR>a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
<BR>knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>I never heard the absent duke much detected for
<BR>women; he was not inclined that way.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>O, sir, you are deceived.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>'Tis not possible.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
<BR>his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
<BR>duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
<BR>that let me inform you.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>You do him wrong, surely.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
<BR>duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
<BR>withdrawing.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>What, I prithee, might be the cause?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
<BR>teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
<BR>understand, the greater file of the subject held the
<BR>duke to be wise.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Wise! why, no question but he was.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
<BR>the very stream of his life and the business he hath
<BR>helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
<BR>proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
<BR>bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
<BR>envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
<BR>Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
<BR>knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Sir, I know him, and I love him.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
<BR>dearer love.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Come, sir, I know what I know.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
<BR>you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
<BR>prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
<BR>answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
<BR>you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
<BR>upon you; and, I pray you, your name?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
<BR>report you.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I fear you not.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
<BR>imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
<BR>can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
<BR>friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
<BR>Claudio die to-morrow or no?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Why should he die, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIO
<td>Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
<BR>the duke we talk of were returned again: the
<BR>ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
<BR>continency; sparrows must not build in his
<BR>house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
<BR>yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
<BR>never bring them to light: would he were returned!
<BR>Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
<BR>Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
<BR>duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
<BR>Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
<BR>he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown

<BR>your honour.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS OVERDONE
<td>My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
<BR>Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
<BR>duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
<BR>is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
<BR>I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
<BR>called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
<BR>no more words.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
<BR>Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
<BR>with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
<BR>if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
<BR>so with him.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
<BR>advised him for the entertainment of death.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>Good even, good father.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Bliss and goodness on you!


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>Of whence are you?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Not of this country, though my chance is now
<BR>To use it for my time: I am a brother
<BR>Of gracious order, late come from the See
<BR>In special business from his holiness.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>What news abroad i' the world?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>None, but that there is so great a fever on
<BR>goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
<BR>novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
<BR>to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
<BR>to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
<BR>truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
<BR>security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
<BR>upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
<BR>news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
<BR>pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>One that, above all other strifes, contended
<BR>especially to know himself.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>What pleasure was he given to?


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
<BR>any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
<BR>gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
<BR>his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
<BR>and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
<BR>prepared. I am made to understand that you have
<BR>lent him visitation.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>He professes to have received no sinister measure
<BR>from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
<BR>to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
<BR>to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
<BR>deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
<BR>leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
<BR>resolved to die.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>You have paid the heavens your function, and the
<BR>prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
<BR>laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
<BR>shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
<BR>found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
<BR>he is indeed Justice.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>If his own life answer the straitness of his
<BR>proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
<BR>chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.


<tr valign=top><td>ESCALUS
<td>I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Peace be with you!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost]

<tr valign=top><td><td>He who the sword of heaven will bear
<BR>Should be as holy as severe;
<BR>Pattern in himself to know,
<BR>Grace to stand, and virtue go;
<BR>More nor less to others paying
<BR>Than by self-offences weighing.
<BR>Shame to him whose cruel striking
<BR>Kills for faults of his own liking!
<BR>Twice treble shame on Angelo,
<BR>To weed my vice and let his grow!
<BR>O, what may man within him hide,
<BR>Though angel on the outward side!
<BR>How may likeness made in crimes,
<BR>Making practise on the times,
<BR>To draw with idle spiders' strings
<BR>Most ponderous and substantial things!
<BR>Craft against vice I must apply:
<BR>With Angelo to-night shall lie
<BR>His old betrothed but despised;
<BR>So disguise shall, by the disguised,

<BR>That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
<BR>Now, sir, what news?


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss

<BR>What say you to this, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the

<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
<BR>that is a prisoner nine years old.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>How came it that the absent duke had not either
<BR>delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
<BR>have heard it was ever his manner to do so.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
<BR>indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
<BR>Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>It is now apparent?


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>Most manifest, and not denied by himself.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
<BR>seems he to be touched?


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
<BR>as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
<BR>of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
<BR>mortality, and desperately mortal.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>He wants advice.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
<BR>of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
<BR>would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
<BR>entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
<BR>to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
<BR>warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
<BR>provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
<BR>truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
<BR>boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
<BR>Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
<BR>no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
<BR>sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
<BR>manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
<BR>for the which you are to do me both a present and a
<BR>dangerous courtesy.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>Pray, sir, in what?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>In the delaying death.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
<BR>and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
<BR>his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
<BR>as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
<BR>instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
<BR>be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
<BR>Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
<BR>the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
<BR>death: you know the course is common. If any thing
<BR>fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
<BR>fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
<BR>against it with my life.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>To him, and to his substitutes.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
<BR>avouch the justice of your dealing?


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>But what likelihood is in that?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
<BR>you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
<BR>persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
<BR>further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
<BR>Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
<BR>duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
<BR>signet is not strange to you.


<tr valign=top><td>Provost
<td>I know them both.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE VINCENTIO
<td>The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
<BR>shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
<BR>shall find, within these two days he will be here.
<BR>This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
<BR>very day receives letters of strange tenor;
<BR>perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
<BR>into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
<BR>is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
<BR>shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
<BR>things should be: all difficulties are but easy
<BR>when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
<BR>with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
<BR>shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
<BR>are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
<BR>Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
