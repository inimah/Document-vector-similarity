<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO

<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS

<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>I have seen nothing.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
<BR>And will not let belief take hold of him
<BR>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
<BR>Therefore I have entreated him along
<BR>With us to watch the minutes of this night;
<BR>That if again this apparition come,
<BR>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO

<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>Sit down awhile;
<BR>And let us once again assail your ears,
<BR>That are so fortified against our story
<BR>What we have two nights seen.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO

<td>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO

<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>It would be spoke to.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Question it, Horatio.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
<BR>Together with that fair and warlike form
<BR>In which the majesty of buried Denmark
<BR>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>It is offended.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>See, it stalks away!


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Ghost]


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>'Tis gone, and will not answer.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
<BR>Is not this something more than fantasy?
<BR>What think you on't?


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>Before my God, I might not this believe
<BR>Without the sensible and true avouch
<BR>Of mine own eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Is it not like the king?


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>As thou art to thyself:
<BR>Such was the very armour he had on
<BR>When he the ambitious Norway combated;
<BR>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
<BR>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
<BR>'Tis strange.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
<BR>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>In what particular thought to work I know not;
<BR>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
<BR>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
<BR>Why this same strict and most observant watch
<BR>So nightly toils the subject of the land,
<BR>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
<BR>And foreign mart for implements of war;
<BR>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
<BR>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
<BR>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
<BR>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
<BR>Who is't that can inform me?


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>That can I;
<BR>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
<BR>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
<BR>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
<BR>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
<BR>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
<BR>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
<BR>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
<BR>Well ratified by law and heraldry,
<BR>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
<BR>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
<BR>Against the which, a moiety competent
<BR>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
<BR>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
<BR>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
<BR>And carriage of the article design'd,
<BR>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
<BR>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
<BR>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
<BR>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
<BR>For food and diet, to some enterprise
<BR>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
<BR>As it doth well appear unto our state--
<BR>But to recover of us, by strong hand
<BR>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
<BR>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
<BR>Is the main motive of our preparations,
<BR>The source of this our watch and the chief head
<BR>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>I think it be no other but e'en so:
<BR>Well may it sort that this portentous figure
<BR>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
<BR>That was and is the question of these wars.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
<BR>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
<BR>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
<BR>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
<BR>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
<BR>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
<BR>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
<BR>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
<BR>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
<BR>And even the like precurse of fierce events,
<BR>As harbingers preceding still the fates
<BR>And prologue to the omen coming on,
<BR>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
<BR>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
<BR>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Ghost]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
<BR>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
<BR>Speak to me:
<BR>If there be any good thing to be done,
<BR>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
<BR>Speak to me:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Cock crows]

<tr valign=top><td><td>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
<BR>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
<BR>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
<BR>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
<BR>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
<BR>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>Do, if it will not stand.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>'Tis here!


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>'Tis here!


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>'Tis gone!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Ghost]

<tr valign=top><td><td>We do it wrong, being so majestical,
<BR>To offer it the show of violence;
<BR>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
<BR>And our vain blows malicious mockery.


<tr valign=top><td>BERNARDO
<td>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>And then it started like a guilty thing
<BR>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
<BR>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
<BR>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
<BR>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
<BR>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
<BR>The extravagant and erring spirit hies
<BR>To his confine: and of the truth herein
<BR>This present object made probation.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>It faded on the crowing of the cock.
<BR>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
<BR>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
<BR>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
<BR>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
<BR>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
<BR>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
<BR>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>So have I heard and do in part believe it.
<BR>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
<BR>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
<BR>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
<BR>Let us impart what we have seen to-night
<BR>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
<BR>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
<BR>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
<BR>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?


<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS
<td>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
<BR>Where we shall find him most conveniently.

<HR><H3><A NAME="xref004">Scene II	A room of state in the castle.</A></H3>


<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
<BR>POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
<BR>and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
<BR>The memory be green, and that it us befitted
<BR>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
<BR>To be contracted in one brow of woe,
<BR>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
<BR>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
<BR>Together with remembrance of ourselves.
<BR>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
<BR>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
<BR>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
<BR>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
<BR>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
<BR>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
<BR>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
<BR>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
<BR>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
<BR>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
<BR>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
<BR>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
<BR>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
<BR>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
<BR>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
<BR>Importing the surrender of those lands
<BR>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
<BR>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
<BR>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
<BR>Thus much the business is: we have here writ
<BR>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
<BR>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
<BR>Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
<BR>His further gait herein; in that the levies,
<BR>The lists and full proportions, are all made
<BR>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
<BR>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
<BR>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
<BR>Giving to you no further personal power
<BR>To business with the king, more than the scope
<BR>Of these delated articles allow.
<BR>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.



<tr valign=top><td>CORNELIUS	
<BR>
<BR>VOLTIMAND	
<td>|
<BR>|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
<BR>|



<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
<BR>You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
<BR>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
<BR>And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
<BR>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
<BR>The head is not more native to the heart,
<BR>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
<BR>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
<BR>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES
<td>My dread lord,
<BR>Your leave and favour to return to France;
<BR>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
<BR>To show my duty in your coronation,
<BR>Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
<BR>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
<BR>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS
<td>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
<BR>By laboursome petition, and at last
<BR>Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
<BR>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
<BR>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
<BR>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN GERTRUDE
<td>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
<BR>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
<BR>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
<BR>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
<BR>Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
<BR>Passing through nature to eternity.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Ay, madam, it is common.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN GERTRUDE
<td>If it be,
<BR>Why seems it so particular with thee?


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
<BR>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
<BR>Nor customary suits of solemn black,
<BR>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
<BR>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
<BR>Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
<BR>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
<BR>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
<BR>For they are actions that a man might play:
<BR>But I have that within which passeth show;
<BR>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
<BR>To give these mourning duties to your father:
<BR>But, you must know, your father lost a father;
<BR>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
<BR>In filial obligation for some term
<BR>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
<BR>In obstinate condolement is a course
<BR>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
<BR>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
<BR>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
<BR>An understanding simple and unschool'd:
<BR>For what we know must be and is as common
<BR>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
<BR>Why should we in our peevish opposition
<BR>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
<BR>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
<BR>To reason most absurd: whose common theme
<BR>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
<BR>From the first corse till he that died to-day,
<BR>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
<BR>This unprevailing woe, and think of us
<BR>As of a father: for let the world take note,
<BR>You are the most immediate to our throne;
<BR>And with no less nobility of love
<BR>Than that which dearest father bears his son,
<BR>Do I impart toward you. For your intent
<BR>In going back to school in Wittenberg,
<BR>It is most retrograde to our desire:
<BR>And we beseech you, bend you to remain
<BR>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
<BR>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN GERTRUDE
<td>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
<BR>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
<BR>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
<BR>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
<BR>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
<BR>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
<BR>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
<BR>And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
<BR>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but HAMLET]


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
<BR>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
<BR>Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
<BR>His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
<BR>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
<BR>Seem to me all the uses of this world!
<BR>Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
<BR>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
<BR>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
<BR>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
<BR>So excellent a king; that was, to this,
<BR>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
<BR>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
<BR>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
<BR>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
<BR>As if increase of appetite had grown
<BR>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
<BR>Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
<BR>A little month, or ere those shoes were old
<BR>With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
<BR>Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
<BR>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
<BR>Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
<BR>My father's brother, but no more like my father
<BR>Than I to Hercules: within a month:
<BR>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
<BR>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
<BR>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
<BR>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
<BR>It is not nor it cannot come to good:
<BR>But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO

<BR>In the dead vast and middle of the night,
<BR>Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
<BR>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
<BR>Appears before them, and with solemn march
<BR>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
<BR>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
<BR>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
<BR>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
<BR>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
<BR>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
<BR>And I with them the third night kept the watch;
<BR>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
<BR>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
<BR>The apparition comes: I knew your father;
<BR>These hands are not more like.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<tr valign=top><td>MARCELLUS

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>My lord, I did;
<BR>But answer made it none: yet once methought
<BR>It lifted up its head and did address
<BR>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
<BR>But even then the morning cock crew loud,
<BR>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
<BR>And vanish'd from our sight.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO

<BR>But let me hear from you.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>Do you doubt that?


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES
<td>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
<BR>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
<BR>A violet in the youth of primy nature,
<BR>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
<BR>The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>No more but so?


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES
<td>Think it no more;
<BR>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
<BR>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
<BR>The inward service of the mind and soul
<BR>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
<BR>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
<BR>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
<BR>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
<BR>For he himself is subject to his birth:
<BR>He may not, as unvalued persons do,
<BR>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
<BR>The safety and health of this whole state;
<BR>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
<BR>Unto the voice and yielding of that body
<BR>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
<BR>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
<BR>As he in his particular act and place
<BR>May give his saying deed; which is no further
<BR>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
<BR>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
<BR>If with too credent ear you list his songs,
<BR>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
<BR>To his unmaster'd importunity.
<BR>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
<BR>And keep you in the rear of your affection,
<BR>Out of the shot and danger of desire.
<BR>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
<BR>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
<BR>Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
<BR>The canker galls the infants of the spring,
<BR>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
<BR>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
<BR>Contagious blastments are most imminent.
<BR>Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
<BR>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

<BR>And these few precepts in thy memory
<BR>See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
<BR>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
<BR>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
<BR>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
<BR>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
<BR>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
<BR>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
<BR>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
<BR>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
<BR>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
<BR>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
<BR>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
<BR>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
<BR>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
<BR>And they in France of the best rank and station
<BR>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
<BR>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
<BR>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
<BR>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
<BR>This above all: to thine ownself be true,
<BR>And it must follow, as the night the day,
<BR>Thou canst not then be false to any man.

<BR>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
<BR>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,

<BR>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
<BR>The better to beguile. This is for all:

<tr valign=top><td>REYNALDO

<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS
<td>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
<BR>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
<BR>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
<BR>What company, at what expense; and finding
<BR>By this encompassment and drift of question
<BR>That they do know my son, come you more nearer
<BR>Than your particular demands will touch it:
<BR>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
<BR>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,

<tr valign=top><td>REYNALDO

<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS

<BR>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
<BR>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
<BR>As are companions noted and most known
<BR>To youth and liberty.


<tr valign=top><td>REYNALDO
<td>As gaming, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS

<td>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
<BR>and 'gentleman.'


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS
<td>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;

<BR>See you now;
<BR>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
<BR>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
<BR>With windlasses and with assays of bias,
<BR>By indirections find directions out:

<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
<BR>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;

<BR>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
<BR>And with a look so piteous in purport
<BR>As if he had been loosed out of hell
<BR>To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS
<td>Mad for thy love?


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>My lord, I do not know;
<BR>But truly, I do fear it.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS

<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
<BR>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
<BR>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
<BR>He falls to such perusal of my face
<BR>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
<BR>At last, a little shaking of mine arm
<BR>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
<BR>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
<BR>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
<BR>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
<BR>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
<BR>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
<BR>For out o' doors he went without their helps,
<BR>And, to the last, bended their light on me.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS
<td>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
<BR>This is the very ecstasy of love,
<BR>Whose violent property fordoes itself
<BR>And leads the will to desperate undertakings
<BR>As oft as any passion under heaven
<BR>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
<BR>What, have you given him any hard words of late?


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
<BR>I did repel his fetters and denied
<BR>His access to me.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD POLONIUS
<td>That hath made him mad.
<BR>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
<BR>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
<BR>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
<BR>By heaven, it is as proper to our age
<BR>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
<BR>As it is common for the younger sort
<BR>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
<BR>This must be known; which, being kept close, might
<BR>move

<BR>To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
<BR>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
<BR>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,

<BR>If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
<BR>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
<BR>Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
<BR>What might you think? No, I went round to work,
<BR>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
<BR>'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
<BR>This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
<BR>That she should lock herself from his resort,
<BR>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
<BR>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
<BR>And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
<BR>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

<tr valign=top><td><td>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad

<BR>play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
<BR>caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
<BR>it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
<BR>cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
<BR>digested in the scenes, set down with as much
<BR>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
<BR>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
<BR>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
<BR>indict the author of affectation; but called it an
<BR>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
<BR>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
<BR>chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
<BR>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
<BR>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
<BR>at this line: let me see, let me see--
<BR>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
<BR>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
<BR>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
<BR>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
<BR>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
<BR>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
<BR>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
<BR>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
<BR>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
<BR>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
<BR>That lend a tyrannous and damned light
<BR>To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
<BR>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
<BR>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
<BR>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

<BR>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,

<BR>Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
<BR>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
<BR>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
<BR>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
<BR>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
<BR>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
<BR>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
<BR>Which was declining on the milky head
<BR>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
<BR>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
<BR>And like a neutral to his will and matter,
<BR>Did nothing.
<BR>But, as we often see, against some storm,
<BR>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
<BR>The bold winds speechless and the orb below
<BR>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
<BR>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,

<BR>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
<BR>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne

<BR>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,

<BR>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
<BR>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
<BR>Upon whose property and most dear life
<BR>A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
<BR>Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
<BR>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?

<BR>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
<BR>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
<BR>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
<BR>A scullion!
<BR>Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
<BR>That guilty creatures sitting at a play
<BR>Have by the very cunning of the scene
<BR>Been struck so to the soul that presently
<BR>They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
<BR>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
<BR>With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
<BR>Play something like the murder of my father
<BR>Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
<BR>I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
<BR>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
<BR>May be the devil: and the devil hath power
<BR>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
<BR>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
<BR>As he is very potent with such spirits,
<BR>Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter HAMLET]


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>To be, or not to be: that is the question:
<BR>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
<BR>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
<BR>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
<BR>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
<BR>No more; and by a sleep to say we end
<BR>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
<BR>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
<BR>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
<BR>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
<BR>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
<BR>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
<BR>Must give us pause: there's the respect
<BR>That makes calamity of so long life;
<BR>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
<BR>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
<BR>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
<BR>The insolence of office and the spurns
<BR>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
<BR>When he himself might his quietus make
<BR>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
<BR>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
<BR>But that the dread of something after death,
<BR>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
<BR>No traveller returns, puzzles the will
<BR>And makes us rather bear those ills we have
<BR>Than fly to others that we know not of?
<BR>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
<BR>And thus the native hue of resolution
<BR>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
<BR>And enterprises of great pith and moment
<BR>With this regard their currents turn awry,
<BR>And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
<BR>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
<BR>Be all my sins remember'd.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>Good my lord,
<BR>How does your honour for this many a day?


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
<BR>That I have longed long to re-deliver;
<BR>I pray you, now receive them.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>No, not I;
<BR>I never gave you aught.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
<BR>And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
<BR>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
<BR>Take these again; for to the noble mind
<BR>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
<BR>There, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Ha, ha! are you honest?


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>My lord?


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Are you fair?


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>What means your lordship?


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<BR>admit no discourse to your beauty.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
<BR>with honesty?


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
<BR>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
<BR>force of honesty can translate beauty into his
<BR>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
<BR>time gives it proof. I did love you once.


<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
<BR>so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of

<tr valign=top><td>OPHELIA
<td>I was the more deceived.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
<BR>breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
<BR>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
<BR>were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
<BR>proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
<BR>my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
<BR>imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
<BR>in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
<BR>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to

<BR>as many of your players do, I had as lief the
<BR>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
<BR>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
<BR>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
<BR>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
<BR>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
<BR>offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
<BR>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
<BR>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
<BR>for the most part are capable of nothing but
<BR>inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
<BR>a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
<BR>out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.


<tr valign=top><td>First Player

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
<BR>be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
<BR>word to the action; with this special observance,
<BR>that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any
<BR>thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose
<BR>end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
<BR>'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own
<BR>feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body
<BR>of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
<BR>or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
<BR>laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
<BR>censure of the which one must in your allowance
<BR>o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
<BR>players that I have seen play, and heard others
<BR>praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
<BR>that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
<BR>the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
<BR>strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
<BR>nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
<BR>well, they imitated humanity so abominably.


<tr valign=top><td>First Player
<td>I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,

<BR>your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
<BR>for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
<BR>set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
<BR>too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
<BR>question of the play be then to be considered:

<BR>As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--

<BR>Which I have told thee of my father's death:
<BR>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
<BR>Even with the very comment of thy soul
<BR>Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
<BR>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
<BR>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,

<BR>About the world have times twelve thirties been,

<tr valign=top><td>Player Queen

<BR>But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
<BR>So far from cheer and from your former state,

<BR>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
<BR>For women's fear and love holds quantity;
<BR>In neither aught, or in extremity.
<BR>Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
<BR>And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
<BR>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
<BR>Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.


<tr valign=top><td>Player King
<td>'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;

<td>[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.


<tr valign=top><td>Player Queen

<BR>When second husband kisses me in bed.


<tr valign=top><td>Player King
<td>I do believe you think what now you speak;
<BR>But what we do determine oft we break.
<BR>Purpose is but the slave to memory,
<BR>Of violent birth, but poor validity;
<BR>Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
<BR>But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
<BR>Most necessary 'tis that we forget
<BR>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
<BR>What to ourselves in passion we propose,
<BR>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
<BR>The violence of either grief or joy
<BR>Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
<BR>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
<BR>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
<BR>This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
<BR>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
<BR>For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
<BR>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
<BR>The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
<BR>The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
<BR>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
<BR>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
<BR>And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
<BR>Directly seasons him his enemy.
<BR>But, orderly to end where I begun,
<BR>Our wills and fates do so contrary run
<BR>That our devices still are overthrown;
<BR>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
<BR>So think thou wilt no second husband wed;

<BR>Meet what I would have well and it destroy!

<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>Not that I think you did not love your father;
<BR>But that I know love is begun by time;
<BR>And that I see, in passages of proof,
<BR>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
<BR>There lives within the very flame of love
<BR>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
<BR>And nothing is at a like goodness still;
<BR>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
<BR>Dies in his own too much: that we would do
<BR>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
<BR>And hath abatements and delays as many
<BR>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
<BR>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
<BR>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
<BR>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
<BR>To show yourself your father's son in deed
<BR>More than in words?

<BR>Most generous and free from all contriving,

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
<BR>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
<BR>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,

<BR>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
<BR>When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us

<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<BR>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
<BR>Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
<BR>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
<BR>To mine own room again; making so bold,
<BR>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
<BR>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
<BR>O royal knavery!--an exact command,
<BR>Larded with many several sorts of reasons
<BR>Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
<BR>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
<BR>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
<BR>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,

<BR>A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
<BR>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
<BR>It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
<BR>The effect of what I wrote?


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>Ay, good my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>An earnest conjuration from the king,

<BR>And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
<BR>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
<BR>Without debatement further, more or less,

<BR>Thou know'st already.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;

<BR>And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,

<BR>continent of what part a gentleman would see.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
<BR>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
<BR>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
<BR>neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
<BR>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
<BR>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
<BR>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
<BR>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
<BR>him, his umbrage, nothing more.


<tr valign=top><td>OSRIC

<tr valign=top><td>OSRIC

<td>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary

<BR>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
<BR>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
<BR>and of very liberal conceit.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<BR>could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
<BR>be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
<BR>against six French swords, their assigns, and three
<BR>liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
<BR>against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?


<tr valign=top><td>OSRIC
<td>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
<BR>between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
<BR>three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it

<BR>would vouchsafe the answer.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>How if I answer 'no'?


<tr valign=top><td>OSRIC
<td>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<BR>play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's

<BR>or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>In happy time.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<BR>about my heart: but it is no matter.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>Nay, good my lord,--


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
<BR>gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.


<tr valign=top><td>HORATIO
<td>If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
<BR>forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
<BR>fit.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
<BR>providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
<BR>'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
<BR>now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<BR>But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
<BR>This presence knows,
<BR>And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
<BR>With sore distraction. What I have done,
<BR>That might your nature, honour and exception
<BR>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
<BR>Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
<BR>If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
<BR>And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
<BR>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
<BR>Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
<BR>Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
<BR>His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
<BR>Sir, in this audience,
<BR>Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
<BR>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
<BR>That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
<BR>And hurt my brother.


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES
<td>I am satisfied in nature,
<BR>Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
<BR>To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
<BR>I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
<BR>Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
<BR>I have a voice and precedent of peace,
<BR>To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
<BR>I do receive your offer'd love like love,
<BR>And will not wrong it.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>I embrace it freely;
<BR>And will this brother's wager frankly play.
<BR>Give us the foils. Come on.


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES
<td>Come, one for me.


<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
<BR>Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
<BR>Stick fiery off indeed.


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET

<tr valign=top><td>HAMLET
<td>Very well, my lord
<BR>Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.


<tr valign=top><td>KING CLAUDIUS
<td>I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
<BR>But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.


<tr valign=top><td>LAERTES

<BR>And in the cup an union shall he throw,

<BR>In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
<BR>And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
<BR>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
<BR>The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,

<BR>Are here arrived give order that these bodies
<BR>High on a stage be placed to the view;

<BR>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
<BR>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,

<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE FORTINBRAS

<BR>Speak loudly for him.
<BR>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
<BR>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
