<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter GLOUCESTER, solus]


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Now is the winter of our discontent
<BR>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
<BR>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
<BR>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
<BR>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
<BR>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
<BR>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
<BR>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
<BR>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
<BR>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
<BR>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
<BR>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
<BR>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
<BR>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
<BR>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
<BR>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
<BR>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
<BR>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
<BR>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
<BR>Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
<BR>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
<BR>And that so lamely and unfashionable
<BR>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
<BR>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
<BR>Have no delight to pass away the time,
<BR>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
<BR>And descant on mine own deformity:
<BR>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
<BR>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
<BR>I am determined to prove a villain
<BR>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
<BR>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
<BR>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
<BR>To set my brother Clarence and the king
<BR>In deadly hate the one against the other:
<BR>And if King Edward be as true and just
<BR>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
<BR>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
<BR>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
<BR>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
<BR>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
<BR>Clarence comes.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
<BR>That waits upon your grace?


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>His majesty
<BR>Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
<BR>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Upon what cause?


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>Because my name is George.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
<BR>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
<BR>O, belike his majesty hath some intent
<BR>That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
<BR>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
<BR>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
<BR>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
<BR>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
<BR>And says a wizard told him that by G
<BR>His issue disinherited should be;
<BR>And, for my name of George begins with G,
<BR>It follows in his thought that I am he.
<BR>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
<BR>Have moved his highness to commit me now.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
<BR>'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
<BR>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
<BR>That tempers him to this extremity.
<BR>Was it not she and that good man of worship,
<BR>Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
<BR>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
<BR>From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
<BR>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
<BR>But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
<BR>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
<BR>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
<BR>Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Humbly complaining to her deity
<BR>Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
<BR>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
<BR>If we will keep in favour with the king,
<BR>To be her men and wear her livery:
<BR>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
<BR>Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
<BR>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
<BR>His majesty hath straitly given in charge
<BR>That no man shall have private conference,
<BR>Of what degree soever, with his brother.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
<BR>You may partake of any thing we say:
<BR>We speak no treason, man: we say the king
<BR>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
<BR>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
<BR>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
<BR>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
<BR>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
<BR>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
<BR>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
<BR>Were best he do it secretly, alone.


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>What one, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
<BR>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
<BR>Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
<BR>And whatsoever you will employ me in,
<BR>Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
<BR>I will perform it to enfranchise you.
<BR>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
<BR>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
<BR>Meantime, have patience.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>I must perforce. Farewell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard]


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
<BR>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
<BR>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
<BR>If heaven will take the present at our hands.
<BR>But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter HASTINGS]


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
<BR>Well are you welcome to the open air.
<BR>How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
<BR>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
<BR>That were the cause of my imprisonment.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
<BR>For they that were your enemies are his,
<BR>And have prevail'd as much on him as you.


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
<BR>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>What news abroad?


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>No news so bad abroad as this at home;
<BR>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
<BR>And his physicians fear him mightily.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
<BR>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
<BR>And overmuch consumed his royal person:
<BR>'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
<BR>What, is he in his bed?


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>He is.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Go you before, and I will follow you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit HASTINGS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
<BR>Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
<BR>I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
<BR>With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
<BR>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
<BR>Clarence hath not another day to live:
<BR>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
<BR>And leave the world for me to bustle in!
<BR>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
<BR>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
<BR>The readiest way to make the wench amends
<BR>Is to become her husband and her father:
<BR>The which will I; not all so much for love
<BR>As for another secret close intent,
<BR>By marrying her which I must reach unto.
<BR>But yet I run before my horse to market:
<BR>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
<BR>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>Set down, set down your honourable load,
<BR>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
<BR>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
<BR>The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
<BR>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
<BR>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
<BR>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
<BR>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
<BR>To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
<BR>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
<BR>Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
<BR>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
<BR>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
<BR>Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
<BR>Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
<BR>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
<BR>More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
<BR>That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
<BR>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
<BR>Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
<BR>If ever he have child, abortive be it,
<BR>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
<BR>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
<BR>May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
<BR>And that be heir to his unhappiness!
<BR>If ever he have wife, let her he made
<BR>A miserable by the death of him
<BR>As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
<BR>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
<BR>Taken from Paul's to be interred there;

<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
<BR>Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
<BR>Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
<BR>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
<BR>Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
<BR>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
<BR>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
<BR>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
<BR>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
<BR>Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
<BR>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
<BR>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
<BR>O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
<BR>Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
<BR>Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
<BR>For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
<BR>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
<BR>Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
<BR>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
<BR>O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
<BR>O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
<BR>Either heaven with lightning strike the
<BR>murderer dead,
<BR>Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
<BR>As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
<BR>Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<BR>Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
<BR>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
<BR>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
<BR>which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
<BR>To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
<BR>And fall somewhat into a slower method,
<BR>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
<BR>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
<BR>As blameful as the executioner?


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
<BR>Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
<BR>To undertake the death of all the world,
<BR>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td><td>[She spitteth at him]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Why dost thou spit at me?


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I would they were, that I might die at once;
<BR>For now they kill me with a living death.
<BR>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
<BR>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
<BR>These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
<BR>No, when my father York and Edward wept,
<BR>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
<BR>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
<BR>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
<BR>Told the sad story of my father's death,
<BR>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
<BR>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
<BR>Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
<BR>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
<BR>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
<BR>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
<BR>I never sued to friend nor enemy;
<BR>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
<BR>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
<BR>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[She looks scornfully at him]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
<BR>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
<BR>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
<BR>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
<BR>Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
<BR>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
<BR>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
<BR>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
<BR>But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
<BR>Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
<BR>But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Here she lets fall the sword]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Take up the sword again, or take up me.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
<BR>I will not be the executioner.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>I have already.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Tush, that was in thy rage:
<BR>Speak it again, and, even with the word,
<BR>That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
<BR>Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
<BR>To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>I would I knew thy heart.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>'Tis figured in my tongue.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>I fear me both are false.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Then never man was true.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>Well, well, put up your sword.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Say, then, my peace is made.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>That shall you know hereafter.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>But shall I live in hope?


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>All men, I hope, live so.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>To take is not to give.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
<BR>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
<BR>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
<BR>And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
<BR>But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
<BR>Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>What is it?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>That it would please thee leave these sad designs
<BR>To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
<BR>And presently repair to Crosby Place;
<BR>Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
<BR>At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
<BR>And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
<BR>I will with all expedient duty see you:
<BR>For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
<BR>Grant me this boon.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE
<td>With all my heart; and much it joys me too,

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER

<tr valign=top><td>LADY ANNE

<BR>But since you teach me how to flatter you,
<BR>Imagine I have said farewell already.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY]

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
<BR>Was ever woman in this humour won?
<BR>I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
<BR>What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
<BR>To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
<BR>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
<BR>The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
<BR>Having God, her conscience, and these bars
<BR>against me,
<BR>And I nothing to back my suit at all,
<BR>But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
<BR>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
<BR>Ha!
<BR>Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
<BR>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
<BR>Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
<BR>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
<BR>Framed in the prodigality of nature,
<BR>Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
<BR>The spacious world cannot again afford
<BR>And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
<BR>That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
<BR>And made her widow to a woful bed?
<BR>On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
<BR>On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
<BR>My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
<BR>I do mistake my person all this while:
<BR>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
<BR>Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
<BR>I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
<BR>And entertain some score or two of tailors,
<BR>To study fashions to adorn my body:
<BR>Since I am crept in favour with myself,
<BR>Will maintain it with some little cost.
<BR>But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
<BR>And then return lamenting to my love.
<BR>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
<BR>That I may see my shadow as I pass.

<tr valign=top><td>RIVERS

<tr valign=top><td>DERBY
<td>I do beseech you, either not believe

<BR>Or, if she be accused in true report,
<BR>Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
<BR>From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.


<tr valign=top><td>RIVERS
<td>Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?


<tr valign=top><td>DERBY
<td>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I

<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELIZABETH
<td>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement

<BR>Who are they that complain unto the king,
<BR>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
<BR>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
<BR>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
<BR>Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
<BR>Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
<BR>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
<BR>I must be held a rancorous enemy.
<BR>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
<BR>But thus his simple truth must be abused
<BR>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?


<tr valign=top><td>RIVERS

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
<BR>When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
<BR>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
<BR>A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
<BR>Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
<BR>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
<BR>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELIZABETH
<td>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.

<BR>Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,

<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELIZABETH
<td>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
<BR>Gloucester;
<BR>You envy my advancement and my friends':

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:

<BR>Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
<BR>Are daily given to ennoble those
<BR>That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELIZABETH
<td>By Him that raised me to this careful height
<BR>From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
<BR>I never did incense his majesty

<tr valign=top><td>RIVERS

<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELIZABETH
<td>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
<BR>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
<BR>By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
<BR>With those gross taunts I often have endured.
<BR>I had rather be a country servant-maid

<BR>I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
<BR>'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Out, devil! I remember them too well:
<BR>Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
<BR>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
<BR>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
<BR>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
<BR>A liberal rewarder of his friends:
<BR>To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>In all which time you and your husband Grey
<BR>Were factious for the house of Lancaster;

<BR>In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
<BR>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY]


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>Why looks your grace so heavily today?


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
<BR>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
<BR>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
<BR>I would not spend another such a night,
<BR>Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
<BR>So full of dismal terror was the time!


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
<BR>And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
<BR>And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
<BR>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
<BR>Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
<BR>And cited up a thousand fearful times,
<BR>During the wars of York and Lancaster
<BR>That had befall'n us. As we paced along
<BR>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
<BR>Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
<BR>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
<BR>Into the tumbling billows of the main.
<BR>Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
<BR>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
<BR>What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
<BR>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
<BR>Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
<BR>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
<BR>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
<BR>All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
<BR>Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
<BR>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
<BR>As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
<BR>Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
<BR>And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>Had you such leisure in the time of death
<BR>To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>Methought I had; and often did I strive
<BR>To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
<BR>Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
<BR>To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
<BR>But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
<BR>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>Awaked you not with this sore agony?


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
<BR>O, then began the tempest to my soul,
<BR>Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
<BR>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
<BR>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
<BR>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
<BR>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
<BR>Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
<BR>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
<BR>And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
<BR>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
<BR>Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
<BR>'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
<BR>That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
<BR>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
<BR>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
<BR>Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
<BR>Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
<BR>I trembling waked, and for a season after
<BR>Could not believe but that I was in hell,
<BR>Such terrible impression made the dream.


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
<BR>I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
<td>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
<BR>Which now bear evidence against my soul,
<BR>For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
<BR>O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
<BR>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
<BR>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
<BR>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
<BR>I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
<BR>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.


<tr valign=top><td>BRAKENBURY
<td>I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[CLARENCE sleeps]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
<BR>Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.

<BR>They often feel a world of restless cares:
<BR>So that, betwixt their tides and low names,

<tr valign=top><td>First Murderer

<tr valign=top><td>Second Murderer

<BR>makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it

<BR>he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
<BR>detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
<BR>mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of

<BR>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
<BR>Before I be convict by course of law,
<BR>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
<BR>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
<BR>By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
<BR>That you depart and lay no hands on me

<tr valign=top><td>Second Murderer

<BR>For in this sin he is as deep as I.
<BR>If God will be revenged for this deed.
<BR>O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,

<tr valign=top><td>YORK

<BR>To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
<BR>Were to incense the boar to follow us

<BR>I took him for the plainest harmless creature

<BR>So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,

<BR>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
<BR>And bestial appetite in change of lust;
<BR>Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
<BR>Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
<BR>Without control, listed to make his prey.
<BR>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
<BR>Tell them, when that my mother went with child
<BR>Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
<BR>My princely father then had wars in France
<BR>And, by just computation of the time,
<BR>Found that the issue was not his begot;
<BR>Which well appeared in his lineaments,

<BR>Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
<BR>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
<BR>His answer was, the people were not wont
<BR>To be spoke to but by the recorder.
<BR>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,

<BR>This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
<BR>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
<BR>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
<BR>And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
<BR>Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
<BR>Which to recure, we heartily solicit
<BR>Your gracious self to take on you the charge
<BR>And kingly government of this your land,
<BR>Not as protector, steward, substitute,
<BR>Or lowly factor for another's gain;

<BR>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
<BR>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
<BR>Definitively thus I answer you.
<BR>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
<BR>Unmeritable shuns your high request.
<BR>First if all obstacles were cut away,
<BR>And that my path were even to the crown,
<BR>As my ripe revenue and due by birth
<BR>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
<BR>So mighty and so many my defects,
<BR>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
<BR>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
<BR>Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
<BR>And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
<BR>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
<BR>And much I need to help you, if need were;
<BR>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
<BR>Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
<BR>Will well become the seat of majesty,
<BR>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
<BR>On him I lay what you would lay on me,
<BR>The right and fortune of his happy stars;
<BR>Which God defend that I should wring from him!


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
<BR>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
<BR>All circumstances well considered.
<BR>You say that Edward is your brother's son:
<BR>So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
<BR>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
<BR>Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
<BR>And afterward by substitute betroth'd
<BR>To Bona, sister to the King of France.
<BR>These both put by a poor petitioner,
<BR>A care-crazed mother of a many children,
<BR>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
<BR>Even in the afternoon of her best days,
<BR>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
<BR>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
<BR>To base declension and loathed bigamy
<BR>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
<BR>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
<BR>More bitterly could I expostulate,
<BR>Save that, for reverence to some alive,
<BR>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
<BR>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
<BR>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
<BR>If non to bless us and the land withal,
<BR>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
<BR>From the corruption of abusing times,

<BR>crown, with divers other Lords]


<tr valign=top><td>RICHMOND
<td>God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
<BR>The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.


<tr valign=top><td>DERBY
<td>Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
<BR>Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
<BR>From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
<BR>Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
<BR>Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHMOND
<td>Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
<BR>But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?


<tr valign=top><td>DERBY
<td>He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
<BR>Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHMOND
<td>What men of name are slain on either side?


<tr valign=top><td>DERBY
<td>John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
<BR>Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHMOND
<td>Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
<BR>Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
<BR>That in submission will return to us:
<BR>And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
<BR>We will unite the white rose and the red:
<BR>Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
<BR>That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
<BR>What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
<BR>England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
<BR>The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
<BR>The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
<BR>The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
<BR>All this divided York and Lancaster,
<BR>Divided in their dire division,
<BR>O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
<BR>The true succeeders of each royal house,
<BR>By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
<BR>And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
<BR>Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
<BR>With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
<BR>Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
<BR>That would reduce these bloody days again,
<BR>And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
<BR>Let them not live to taste this land's increase
<BR>That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
<BR>Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
<BR>That she may long live here, God say amen!
