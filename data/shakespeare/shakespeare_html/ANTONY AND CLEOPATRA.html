<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO]


<tr valign=top><td>PHILO
<td>Nay, but this dotage of our general's
<BR>O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
<BR>That o'er the files and musters of the war
<BR>Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
<BR>The office and devotion of their view
<BR>Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
<BR>Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
<BR>The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
<BR>And is become the bellows and the fan
<BR>To cool a gipsy's lust.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,
<BR>the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Look, where they come:
<BR>Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
<BR>The triple pillar of the world transform'd
<BR>Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>If it be love indeed, tell me how much.


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter an Attendant]


<tr valign=top><td>Attendant
<td>News, my good lord, from Rome.


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>Grates me: the sum.


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>Nay, hear them, Antony:
<BR>Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
<BR>If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
<BR>His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
<BR>Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
<BR>Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>How, my love!


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>Perchance! nay, and most like:
<BR>You must not stay here longer, your dismission
<BR>Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
<BR>Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
<BR>Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
<BR>Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
<BR>Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
<BR>When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
<BR>Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
<BR>Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
<BR>Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
<BR>Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Embracing]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
<BR>On pain of punishment, the world to weet
<BR>We stand up peerless.


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>Excellent falsehood!
<BR>Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
<BR>I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
<BR>Will be himself.


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
<BR>Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
<BR>Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
<BR>There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
<BR>Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>Hear the ambassadors.


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>Fie, wrangling queen!
<BR>Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
<BR>To weep; whose every passion fully strives
<BR>To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
<BR>No messenger, but thine; and all alone
<BR>To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
<BR>The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
<BR>Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with

<tr valign=top><td>DEMETRIUS
<td>Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?


<tr valign=top><td>PHILO
<td>Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
<BR>He comes too short of that great property
<BR>Which still should go with Antony.


<tr valign=top><td>DEMETRIUS
<td>I am full sorry
<BR>That he approves the common liar, who
<BR>Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
<BR>Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer

<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN

<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer

<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN

<tr valign=top><td>ALEXAS
<td>Nay, hear him.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN
<td>Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
<BR>to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
<BR>let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
<BR>may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
<BR>Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.


<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer
<td>You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN
<td>O excellent! I love long life better than figs.


<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer
<td>You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
<BR>Than that which is to approach.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN
<td>Then belike my children shall have no names:

<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer
<td>If every of your wishes had a womb.
<BR>And fertile every wish, a million.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN

<tr valign=top><td>IRAS
<td>Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN
<td>Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful

<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer

<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN

<tr valign=top><td>CHARMIAN
<td>Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
<BR>his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
<BR>that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
<BR>her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
<BR>follow worse, till the worst of all follow him

<tr valign=top><td>IRAS
<td>Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!

<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY

<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>Why, then, we kill all our women:

<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY

<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
<BR>pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
<BR>them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
<BR>nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
<BR>this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
<BR>times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit ALEXAS]


<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
<BR>the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
<BR>winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
<BR>storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
<BR>cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a

<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY

<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY

<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>Fulvia!


<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>Dead.


<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
<BR>it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
<BR>from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
<BR>comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
<BR>out, there are members to make new. If there were
<BR>no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
<BR>and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
<BR>with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new

<BR>that should water this sorrow.

<tr valign=top><td>MARK ANTONY
<td>No more light answers. Let our officers
<BR>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
<BR>The cause of our expedience to the queen,
<BR>And get her leave to part. For not alone
<BR>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
<BR>Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
<BR>Of many our contriving friends in Rome
<BR>Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
<BR>Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
<BR>The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
<BR>Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
<BR>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
<BR>Pompey the Great and all his dignities
<BR>Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
<BR>Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
<BR>For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,

<BR>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
<BR>The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like

<tr valign=top><td>OCTAVIUS CAESAR

<BR>No way excuse his soils, when we do bear

<BR>They make in Italy; the borders maritime
<BR>Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:

<BR>Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
<BR>Than could his war resisted.


<tr valign=top><td>OCTAVIUS CAESAR
<td>Antony,
<BR>Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
<BR>Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
<BR>Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
<BR>Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
<BR>Though daintily brought up, with patience more
<BR>Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
<BR>The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
<BR>Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
<BR>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
<BR>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
<BR>The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
<BR>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
<BR>Which some did die to look on: and all this--
<BR>It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
<BR>Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek

<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>I will tell you.
<BR>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
<BR>Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
<BR>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
<BR>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
<BR>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
<BR>The water which they beat to follow faster,
<BR>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
<BR>It beggar'd all description: she did lie
<BR>In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
<BR>O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
<BR>The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
<BR>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
<BR>With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
<BR>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
<BR>And what they undid did.

<td>O, rare for Antony!

<BR>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
<BR>That yarely frame the office. From the barge
<BR>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
<BR>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
<BR>Her people out upon her; and Antony,
<BR>Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
<BR>Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
<BR>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
<BR>And made a gap in nature.

<BR>Invited her to supper: she replied,
<BR>It should be better he became her guest;
<BR>Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
<BR>Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
<BR>Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
<BR>And for his ordinary pays his heart
<BR>For what his eyes eat only.


<tr valign=top><td>AGRIPPA
<td>Royal wench!
<BR>She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
<BR>He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.


<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
<td>I saw her once
<BR>Hop forty paces through the public street;
<BR>And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
<BR>That she did make defect perfection,
<BR>And, breathless, power breathe forth.


<tr valign=top><td>MECAENAS
<td>Now Antony must leave her utterly.


<tr valign=top><td>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

<td>My good knave Eros, now thy captain is

<BR>Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
<BR>A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
<BR>Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory

<BR>There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
<BR>That grew the more by reaping: his delights
<BR>Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above

<tr valign=top><td>CLEOPATRA
<td>You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
