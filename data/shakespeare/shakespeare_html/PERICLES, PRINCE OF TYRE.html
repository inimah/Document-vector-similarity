<tr valign=top><td><td>To sing a song that old was sung,
<BR>From ashes ancient Gower is come;
<BR>Assuming man's infirmities,
<BR>To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
<BR>It hath been sung at festivals,
<BR>On ember-eves and holy-ales;
<BR>And lords and ladies in their lives
<BR>Have read it for restoratives:
<BR>The purchase is to make men glorious;

<BR>This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
<BR>Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
<BR>The fairest in all Syria,
<BR>I tell you what mine authors say:
<BR>This king unto him took a fere,
<BR>Who died and left a female heir,
<BR>So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
<BR>As heaven had lent her all his grace;
<BR>With whom the father liking took,
<BR>And her to incest did provoke:
<BR>Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
<BR>To evil should be done by none:
<BR>But custom what they did begin
<BR>Was with long use account no sin.
<BR>The beauty of this sinful dame
<BR>Made many princes thither frame,
<BR>To seek her as a bed-fellow,
<BR>In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
<BR>Which to prevent he made a law,
<BR>To keep her still, and men in awe,
<BR>That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
<BR>His riddle told not, lost his life:
<BR>So for her many a wight did die,
<BR>As yon grim looks do testify.

<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
<BR>The danger of the task you undertake.


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
<BR>Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
<BR>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
<BR>For the embracements even of Jove himself;
<BR>At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
<BR>Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
<BR>The senate-house of planets all did sit,
<BR>To knit in her their best perfections.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
<BR>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
<BR>Of every virtue gives renown to men!
<BR>Her face the book of praises, where is read
<BR>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
<BR>Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
<BR>Could never be her mild companion.
<BR>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
<BR>That have inflamed desire in my breast
<BR>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
<BR>Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
<BR>As I am son and servant to your will,
<BR>To compass such a boundless happiness!


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>Prince Pericles,--


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>That would be son to great Antiochus.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
<BR>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
<BR>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
<BR>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
<BR>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
<BR>And which, without desert, because thine eye
<BR>Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
<BR>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
<BR>Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
<BR>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
<BR>That without covering, save yon field of stars,
<BR>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
<BR>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
<BR>For going on death's net, whom none resist.


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
<BR>My frail mortality to know itself,
<BR>And by those fearful objects to prepare
<BR>This body, like to them, to what I must;
<BR>For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
<BR>Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
<BR>I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
<BR>Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
<BR>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
<BR>So I bequeath a happy peace to you
<BR>And all good men, as every prince should do;
<BR>My riches to the earth from whence they came;
<BR>But my unspotted fire of love to you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Thus ready for the way of life or death,
<BR>I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
<BR>Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
<BR>As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.


<tr valign=top><td>Daughter
<td>Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
<BR>Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
<BR>Nor ask advice of any other thought
<BR>But faithfulness and courage.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[He reads the riddle]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I am no viper, yet I feed
<BR>On mother's flesh which did me breed.
<BR>I sought a husband, in which labour
<BR>I found that kindness in a father:
<BR>He's father, son, and husband mild;
<BR>I mother, wife, and yet his child.
<BR>How they may be, and yet in two,
<BR>As you will live, resolve it you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
<BR>That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
<BR>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
<BR>If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
<BR>Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
<BR>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
<BR>For he's no man on whom perfections wait
<BR>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
<BR>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
<BR>Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
<BR>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:
<BR>But being play'd upon before your time,
<BR>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
<BR>Good sooth, I care not for you.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
<BR>For that's an article within our law,
<BR>As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
<BR>Either expound now, or receive your sentence.


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>Great king,
<BR>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
<BR>'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
<BR>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
<BR>He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
<BR>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
<BR>Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;
<BR>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
<BR>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
<BR>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
<BR>Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
<BR>By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
<BR>Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
<BR>their will;
<BR>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
<BR>It is enough you know; and it is fit,
<BR>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
<BR>All love the womb that their first being bred,
<BR>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS
<td>[Aside]  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
<BR>the meaning:
<BR>But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
<BR>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
<BR>Your exposition misinterpreting,
<BR>We might proceed to cancel of your days;
<BR>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
<BR>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
<BR>Forty days longer we do respite you;
<BR>If by which time our secret be undone,
<BR>This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
<BR>And until then your entertain shall be
<BR>As doth befit our honour and your worth.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but PERICLES]


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
<BR>When what is done is like an hypocrite,
<BR>The which is good in nothing but in sight!
<BR>If it be true that I interpret false,
<BR>Then were it certain you were not so bad
<BR>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
<BR>Where now you're both a father and a son,
<BR>By your untimely claspings with your child,
<BR>Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
<BR>And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
<BR>By the defiling of her parent's bed;
<BR>And both like serpents are, who though they feed
<BR>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
<BR>Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
<BR>Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
<BR>Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
<BR>One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
<BR>Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
<BR>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
<BR>Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
<BR>Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
<BR>By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter ANTIOCHUS]


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS

<BR>To have his head.
<BR>He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
<BR>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
<BR>In such a loathed manner;
<BR>And therefore instantly this prince must die:
<BR>For by his fall my honour must keep high.
<BR>Who attends us there?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter THALIARD]


<tr valign=top><td>THALIARD

<tr valign=top><td>ANTIOCHUS

<BR>You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
<BR>Her private actions to your secrecy;
<BR>And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
<BR>Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
<BR>We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
<BR>It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
<BR>Because we bid it. Say, is it done?


<tr valign=top><td>THALIARD

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PERICLES]


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should
<BR>this change of thoughts,
<BR>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
<BR>Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
<BR>In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
<BR>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
<BR>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
<BR>And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
<BR>Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
<BR>Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
<BR>Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
<BR>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
<BR>That have their first conception by mis-dread,
<BR>Have after-nourishment and life by care;
<BR>And what was first but fear what might be done,
<BR>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
<BR>And so with me: the great Antiochus,
<BR>'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
<BR>Since he's so great can make his will his act,
<BR>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
<BR>Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
<BR>If he suspect I may dishonour him:
<BR>And what may make him blush in being known,
<BR>He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
<BR>With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
<BR>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
<BR>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
<BR>Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
<BR>And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
<BR>Which care of them, not pity of myself,
<BR>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
<BR>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
<BR>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
<BR>And punish that before that he would punish.

<tr valign=top><td>HELICANUS
<td>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
<BR>They do abuse the king that flatter him:
<BR>For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
<BR>The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
<BR>To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
<BR>Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
<BR>Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
<BR>When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,

<BR>I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
<BR>That kings should let their ears hear their
<BR>faults hid!
<BR>Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
<BR>Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
<BR>What wouldst thou have me do?


<tr valign=top><td>HELICANUS
<td>To bear with patience
<BR>Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.


<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
<BR>That minister'st a potion unto me
<BR>That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
<BR>Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
<BR>Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
<BR>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
<BR>From whence an issue I might propagate,
<BR>Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
<BR>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
<BR>The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
<BR>Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
<BR>Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
<BR>know'st this,
<BR>'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
<BR>Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
<BR>Under the covering of a careful night,
<BR>Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
<BR>Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
<BR>I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
<BR>Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
<BR>And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
<BR>That I should open to the listening air
<BR>How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
<BR>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
<BR>To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
<BR>And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
<BR>When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
<BR>Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
<BR>Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
<BR>Who now reprovest me for it,--


<tr valign=top><td>HELICANUS

<tr valign=top><td>PERICLES
<td>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
<BR>Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
<BR>How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
<BR>And finding little comfort to relieve them,
<BR>I thought it princely charity to grieve them.


<tr valign=top><td>HELICANUS
<td>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
<BR>Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
<BR>And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
<BR>Who either by public war or private treason
<BR>Will take away your life.
<BR>Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
<BR>Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
<BR>Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
<BR>Your rule direct to any; if to me.

<BR>The care I had and have of subjects' good
<BR>On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
<BR>I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
<BR>Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:

<BR>Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
<BR>That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
