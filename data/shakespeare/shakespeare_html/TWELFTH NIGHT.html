<BR>Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
<BR>The appetite may sicken, and so die.
<BR>That strain again! it had a dying fall:
<BR>O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
<BR>That breathes upon a bank of violets,
<BR>Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
<BR>'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
<BR>O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
<BR>That, notwithstanding thy capacity
<BR>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
<BR>Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
<BR>But falls into abatement and low price,
<BR>Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
<BR>That it alone is high fantastical.


<tr valign=top><td>CURIO

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>What, Curio?


<tr valign=top><td>CURIO
<td>The hart.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
<BR>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
<BR>Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
<BR>That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
<BR>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
<BR>E'er since pursue me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter VALENTINE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now! what news from her?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
<BR>But from her handmaid do return this answer:
<BR>The element itself, till seven years' heat,
<BR>Shall not behold her face at ample view;
<BR>But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
<BR>And water once a day her chamber round
<BR>With eye-offending brine: all this to season
<BR>A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
<BR>And lasting in her sad remembrance.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
<BR>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
<BR>How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
<BR>Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
<BR>That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
<BR>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
<BR>Her sweet perfections with one self king!
<BR>Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
<BR>Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>What country, friends, is this?


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>This is Illyria, lady.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>And what should I do in Illyria?
<BR>My brother he is in Elysium.
<BR>Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
<BR>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
<BR>When you and those poor number saved with you
<BR>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
<BR>Most provident in peril, bind himself,
<BR>Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
<BR>To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
<BR>Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
<BR>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
<BR>So long as I could see.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>For saying so, there's gold:
<BR>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
<BR>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
<BR>The like of him. Know'st thou this country?


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
<BR>Not three hours' travel from this very place.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>Who governs here?


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>A noble duke, in nature as in name.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>What is the name?


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>Orsino.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
<BR>He was a bachelor then.


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>And so is now, or was so very late;
<BR>For but a month ago I went from hence,
<BR>And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
<BR>What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
<BR>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>What's she?


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
<BR>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
<BR>In the protection of his son, her brother,
<BR>Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
<BR>They say, she hath abjured the company
<BR>And sight of men.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>O that I served that lady
<BR>And might not be delivered to the world,
<BR>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
<BR>What my estate is!


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>That were hard to compass;
<BR>Because she will admit no kind of suit,
<BR>No, not the duke's.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
<BR>And though that nature with a beauteous wall
<BR>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
<BR>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
<BR>With this thy fair and outward character.
<BR>I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
<BR>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
<BR>For such disguise as haply shall become
<BR>The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
<BR>Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
<BR>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
<BR>And speak to him in many sorts of music
<BR>That will allow me very worth his service.
<BR>What else may hap to time I will commit;
<BR>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.


<tr valign=top><td>Captain
<td>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
<BR>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>I thank thee: lead me on.

<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
<BR>her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
<BR>nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
<BR>exceptions to your ill hours.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Why, let her except, before excepted.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
<BR>limits of order.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
<BR>these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
<BR>these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
<BR>themselves in their own straps.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
<BR>my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
<BR>knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Ay, he.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>What's that to the purpose?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
<BR>he's a very fool and a prodigal.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
<BR>viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
<BR>word for word without book, and hath all the good
<BR>gifts of nature.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
<BR>he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
<BR>he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
<BR>hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
<BR>he would quickly have the gift of a grave.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
<BR>that say so of him. Who are they?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
<BR>her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
<BR>drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
<BR>that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
<BR>o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
<BR>Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter SIR ANDREW]

<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Bless you, fair shrew.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>And you too, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>What's that?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>My niece's chambermaid.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>My name is Mary, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Good Mistress Mary Accost,--


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
<BR>her, woo her, assail her.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
<BR>company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Fare you well, gentlemen.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
<BR>never draw sword again.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
<BR>draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
<BR>fools in hand?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Sir, I have not you by the hand.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
<BR>your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>It's dry, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
<BR>keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>A dry jest, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Are you full of them?


<tr valign=top><td>MARIA
<td>Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
<BR>now I let go your hand, I am barren.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
<BR>see thee so put down?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
<BR>put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
<BR>than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
<BR>great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>No question.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
<BR>to-morrow, Sir Toby.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Pourquoi, my dear knight?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
<BR>bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
<BR>fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
<BR>followed the arts!


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Why, would that have mended my hair?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>But it becomes me well enough, does't not?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
<BR>hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
<BR>and spin it off.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
<BR>will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
<BR>she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
<BR>her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
<BR>have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
<BR>man.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
<BR>strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
<BR>and revels sometimes altogether.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
<BR>degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
<BR>with an old man.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Faith, I can cut a caper.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>And I can cut the mutton to't.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
<BR>as any man in Illyria.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
<BR>these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
<BR>take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
<BR>thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
<BR>a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
<BR>so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
<BR>dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
<BR>I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
<BR>leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW
<td>Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
<BR>flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR TOBY BELCH
<td>What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR ANDREW

<BR>Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
<BR>Come, but one verse.


<tr valign=top><td>CURIO

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit CURIO. Music plays]

<td>She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>About your years, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
<BR>An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
<BR>So sways she level in her husband's heart:
<BR>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
<BR>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
<BR>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
<BR>Than women's are.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>I think it well, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>Then let thy love be younger than thyself,

<BR>Not a flower, not a flower sweet

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>There is no woman's sides

<BR>Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>What dost thou know?


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>Too well what love women to men may owe:

<BR>As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
<BR>I should your lordship.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>And what's her history?


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
<BR>But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
<BR>Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
<BR>And with a green and yellow melancholy
<BR>She sat like patience on a monument,
<BR>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
<BR>We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
<BR>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
<BR>Much in our vows, but little in our love.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

<BR>with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits

<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>Why, man?


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that

<BR>in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
<BR>'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
<BR>let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
<BR>thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
<BR>consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
<BR>face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
<BR>habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
<BR>limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
<BR>thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
<BR>fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
<BR>after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
<BR>adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
<BR>scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
<BR>or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
<BR>that can be can come between me and the full

<BR>I'll bring you to a captain in this town,

<BR>All the occurrence of my fortune since

<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
<BR>But nature to her bias drew in that.
<BR>You would have been contracted to a maid;
<BR>Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
<BR>You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
<BR>If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
<BR>I shall have share in this most happy wreck.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To VIOLA]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
<BR>Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>And all those sayings will I overswear;
<BR>And those swearings keep as true in soul
<BR>As doth that orbed continent the fire
<BR>That severs day from night.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE ORSINO
<td>Give me thy hand;
<BR>And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.


<tr valign=top><td>VIOLA
<td>The captain that did bring me first on shore
<BR>Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
<BR>Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
<BR>A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA
<td>He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
<BR>And yet, alas, now I remember me,
<BR>They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN]

<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
<BR>well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
<BR>letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
<BR>morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,

<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA

<tr valign=top><td><td>'By the Lord, madam,'--


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA

<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
<BR>will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA
<td>Prithee, read i' thy right wits.


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To FABIAN]


<tr valign=top><td>FABIAN

<BR>world shall know it: though you have put me into
<BR>darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
<BR>me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
<BR>your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
<BR>me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
<BR>not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
<BR>Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little

<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA

<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA
<td>Have I, Malvolio? no.


<tr valign=top><td>MALVOLIO
<td>Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
<BR>You must not now deny it is your hand:
<BR>Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
<BR>Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
<BR>You can say none of this: well, grant it then
<BR>And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
<BR>Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
<BR>Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
<BR>To put on yellow stockings and to frown
<BR>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
<BR>And, acting this in an obedient hope,
<BR>Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
<BR>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
<BR>And made the most notorious geck and gull
<BR>That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA
<td>Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
<BR>Though, I confess, much like the character
<BR>But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
<BR>And now I do bethink me, it was she
<BR>First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
<BR>And in such forms which here were presupposed
<BR>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
<BR>This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
<BR>But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
<BR>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
<BR>Of thine own cause.


<tr valign=top><td>FABIAN
<td>Good madam, hear me speak,
<BR>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
<BR>Taint the condition of this present hour,
<BR>Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
<BR>Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
<BR>Set this device against Malvolio here,
<BR>Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
<BR>We had conceived against him: Maria writ
<BR>The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
<BR>In recompense whereof he hath married her.
<BR>How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
<BR>May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
<BR>If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
<BR>That have on both sides pass'd.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVIA

<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,

<BR>But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
<BR>a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
<BR>and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
