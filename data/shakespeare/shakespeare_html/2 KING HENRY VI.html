<BR>So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
<BR>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,

<BR>Deliver up my title in the queen
<BR>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance

<BR>The fairest queen that ever king received.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
<BR>I can express no kinder sign of love
<BR>Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,
<BR>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
<BR>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
<BR>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
<BR>If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Great King of England and my gracious lord,
<BR>The mutual conference that my mind hath had,
<BR>By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
<BR>In courtly company or at my beads,
<BR>With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,
<BR>Makes me the bolder to salute my king
<BR>With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
<BR>And over-joy of heart doth minister.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
<BR>Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
<BR>Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;
<BR>Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
<BR>Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.

<BR>the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,
<BR>daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Pardon me, gracious lord;

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>[Reads]  'Item, It is further agreed between them,
<BR>that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be
<BR>released and delivered over to the king her father,
<BR>and she sent over of the King of England's own
<BR>proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:
<BR>We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,
<BR>And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
<BR>We here discharge your grace from being regent
<BR>I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
<BR>Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
<BR>Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
<BR>Salisbury, and Warwick;
<BR>We thank you all for the great favour done,
<BR>In entertainment to my princely queen.
<BR>Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
<BR>To see her coronation be perform'd.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK]


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
<BR>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
<BR>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
<BR>What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
<BR>His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
<BR>Did he so often lodge in open field,
<BR>In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
<BR>To conquer France, his true inheritance?
<BR>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
<BR>To keep by policy what Henry got?
<BR>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
<BR>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
<BR>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?
<BR>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
<BR>With all the learned council of the realm,
<BR>Studied so long, sat in the council-house
<BR>Early and late, debating to and fro
<BR>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
<BR>And had his highness in his infancy
<BR>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
<BR>And shall these labours and these honours die?
<BR>Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
<BR>Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
<BR>O peers of England, shameful is this league!
<BR>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
<BR>Blotting your names from books of memory,
<BR>Razing the characters of your renown,
<BR>Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
<BR>Undoing all, as all had never been!


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
<BR>This peroration with such circumstance?
<BR>For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;
<BR>But now it is impossible we should:
<BR>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
<BR>Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
<BR>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
<BR>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY
<td>Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
<BR>These counties were the keys of Normandy.
<BR>But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>For grief that they are past recovery:
<BR>For, were there hope to conquer them again,
<BR>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
<BR>Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
<BR>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
<BR>And are the cities, that I got with wounds,
<BR>Delivered up again with peaceful words?
<BR>Mort Dieu!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
<BR>That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
<BR>France should have torn and rent my very heart,
<BR>Before I would have yielded to this league.
<BR>I never read but England's kings have had
<BR>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
<BR>And our King Henry gives away his own,
<BR>To match with her that brings no vantages.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>A proper jest, and never heard before,
<BR>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
<BR>For costs and charges in transporting her!
<BR>She should have stayed in France and starved
<BR>in France, Before--


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:
<BR>It was the pleasure of my lord the King.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
<BR>'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
<BR>But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
<BR>Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
<BR>I see thy fury: if I longer stay,
<BR>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
<BR>Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
<BR>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>So, there goes our protector in a rage.
<BR>'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
<BR>Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
<BR>And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
<BR>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
<BR>And heir apparent to the English crown:
<BR>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
<BR>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
<BR>There's reason he should be displeased at it.
<BR>Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
<BR>Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
<BR>What though the common people favour him,
<BR>Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of
<BR>Gloucester,'
<BR>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
<BR>'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
<BR>With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
<BR>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
<BR>He will be found a dangerous protector.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,
<BR>He being of age to govern of himself?
<BR>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
<BR>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
<BR>We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>This weighty business will not brook delay:
<BR>I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>SOMERSET
<td>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
<BR>And greatness of his place be grief to us,
<BR>Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
<BR>His insolence is more intolerable
<BR>Than all the princes in the land beside:
<BR>If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,
<BR>Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET]


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY
<td>Pride went before, ambition follows him.
<BR>While these do labour for their own preferment,
<BR>Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
<BR>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
<BR>Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
<BR>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,
<BR>More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
<BR>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
<BR>Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
<BR>Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
<BR>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
<BR>Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,
<BR>Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
<BR>Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
<BR>And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
<BR>In bringing them to civil discipline,
<BR>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
<BR>When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
<BR>Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:
<BR>Join we together, for the public good,
<BR>In what we can, to bridle and suppress
<BR>The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
<BR>With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
<BR>And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
<BR>While they do tend the profit of the land.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
<BR>And common profit of his country!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>[Aside]  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY
<td>Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
<BR>That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
<BR>And would have kept so long as breath did last!
<BR>Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
<BR>Which I will win from France, or else be slain,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY]


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
<BR>Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
<BR>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
<BR>Suffolk concluded on the articles,
<BR>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
<BR>To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
<BR>I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
<BR>'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
<BR>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
<BR>And purchase friends and give to courtezans,
<BR>Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
<BR>While as the silly owner of the goods
<BR>Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
<BR>And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
<BR>While all is shared and all is borne away,
<BR>Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
<BR>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
<BR>While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
<BR>Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland
<BR>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
<BR>As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
<BR>Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
<BR>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
<BR>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
<BR>Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
<BR>A day will come when York shall claim his own;
<BR>And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
<BR>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
<BR>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
<BR>For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:
<BR>Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
<BR>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
<BR>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
<BR>Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
<BR>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
<BR>Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
<BR>To pry into the secrets of the state;
<BR>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
<BR>With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
<BR>And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
<BR>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
<BR>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;
<BR>And in my standard bear the arms of York
<BR>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
<BR>And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
<BR>Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK]


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
<BR>Our simple supper ended, give me leave
<BR>In this close walk to satisfy myself,
<BR>In craving your opinion of my title,
<BR>Which is infallible, to England's crown.


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY
<td>My lord, I long to hear it at full.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
<BR>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Then thus:
<BR>Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
<BR>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
<BR>The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,
<BR>Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
<BR>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
<BR>The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
<BR>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
<BR>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
<BR>Edward the Black Prince died before his father
<BR>And left behind him Richard, his only son,
<BR>Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;
<BR>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
<BR>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
<BR>Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
<BR>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
<BR>Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
<BR>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
<BR>Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Father, the duke hath told the truth:
<BR>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Which now they hold by force and not by right;
<BR>For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
<BR>The issue of the next son should have reign'd.


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY
<td>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
<BR>I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,
<BR>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
<BR>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
<BR>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY
<td>This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
<BR>As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
<BR>And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
<BR>Who kept him in captivity till he died.
<BR>But to the rest.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>His eldest sister, Anne,
<BR>My mother, being heir unto the crown
<BR>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son
<BR>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
<BR>By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
<BR>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
<BR>Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
<BR>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:
<BR>So, if the issue of the elder son
<BR>Succeed before the younger, I am king.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
<BR>Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
<BR>The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
<BR>Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:
<BR>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
<BR>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
<BR>Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;
<BR>And in this private plot be we the first
<BR>That shall salute our rightful sovereign
<BR>With honour of his birthright to the crown.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTH
<td>Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
<BR>Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
<BR>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
<BR>And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
<BR>But with advice and silent secrecy.
<BR>Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
<BR>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
<BR>At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
<BR>At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
<BR>Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
<BR>That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
<BR>'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that
<BR>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.


<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY

<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
<BR>Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
<BR>'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
<BR>Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Can you not see? or will ye not observe
<BR>The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
<BR>With what a majesty he bears himself,
<BR>How insolent of late he is become,
<BR>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
<BR>We know the time since he was mild and affable,
<BR>And if we did but glance a far-off look,
<BR>Immediately he was upon his knee,
<BR>That all the court admired him for submission:
<BR>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
<BR>When every one will give the time of day,
<BR>He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
<BR>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
<BR>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
<BR>Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
<BR>But great men tremble when the lion roars;
<BR>And Humphrey is no little man in England.
<BR>First note that he is near you in descent,
<BR>And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
<BR>Me seemeth then it is no policy,
<BR>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
<BR>And his advantage following your decease,
<BR>That he should come about your royal person
<BR>Or be admitted to your highness' council.
<BR>By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
<BR>And when he please to make commotion,
<BR>'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
<BR>Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
<BR>Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden
<BR>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
<BR>The reverent care I bear unto my lord
<BR>Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
<BR>If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;
<BR>Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
<BR>I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
<BR>My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
<BR>Reprove my allegation, if you can;
<BR>Or else conclude my words effectual.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
<BR>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
<BR>I think I should have told your grace's tale.
<BR>The duchess, by his subornation,
<BR>Upon my life, began her devilish practises:
<BR>Or, if he were not privy to those faults,
<BR>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
<BR>As next the king he was successive heir,
<BR>And such high vaunts of his nobility,
<BR>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
<BR>By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
<BR>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
<BR>And in his simple show he harbours treason.
<BR>The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
<BR>No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
<BR>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>Did he not, contrary to form of law,
<BR>Devise strange deaths for small offences done?


<tr valign=top><td>YORK

<BR>For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
<BR>To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
<BR>Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,
<BR>Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
<BR>From meaning treason to our royal person
<BR>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
<BR>The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
<BR>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
<BR>Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,
<BR>For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
<BR>Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,
<BR>For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
<BR>Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
<BR>Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all

<BR>Nor change my countenance for this arrest:

<BR>The purest spring is not so free from mud
<BR>As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:

<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,
<BR>And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;

<BR>Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,
<BR>That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,
<BR>Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
<BR>Be brought against me at my trial-day!
<BR>No; many a pound of mine own proper store,

<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I say no more than truth, so help me God!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>In your protectorship you did devise
<BR>Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,
<BR>That England was defamed by tyranny.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was
<BR>protector,
<BR>Pity was all the fault that was in me;
<BR>For I should melt at an offender's tears,
<BR>And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
<BR>Unless it were a bloody murderer,
<BR>Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
<BR>I never gave them condign punishment:
<BR>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured
<BR>Above the felon or what trespass else.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:
<BR>But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
<BR>Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
<BR>I do arrest you in his highness' name;
<BR>And here commit you to my lord cardinal
<BR>To keep, until your further time of trial.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
<BR>That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
<BR>My conscience tells me you are innocent.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:
<BR>Virtue is choked with foul ambition
<BR>And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;
<BR>Foul subornation is predominant
<BR>And equity exiled your highness' land.
<BR>I know their complot is to have my life,
<BR>And if my death might make this island happy,
<BR>And prove the period of their tyranny,
<BR>I would expend it with all willingness:
<BR>But mine is made the prologue to their play;
<BR>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
<BR>Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
<BR>Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
<BR>And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
<BR>Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
<BR>The envious load that lies upon his heart;
<BR>And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
<BR>Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
<BR>By false accuse doth level at my life:
<BR>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
<BR>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
<BR>And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
<BR>My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
<BR>Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
<BR>Myself had notice of your conventicles--
<BR>And all to make away my guiltless life.
<BR>I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
<BR>Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
<BR>The ancient proverb will be well effected:
<BR>'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL
<td>My liege, his railing is intolerable:
<BR>If those that care to keep your royal person
<BR>From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
<BR>Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,
<BR>And the offender granted scope of speech,
<BR>'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK

<BR>With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,

<BR>False allegations to o'erthrow his state?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;

<BR>And well such losers may have leave to speak.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM

<BR>Before his legs be firm to bear his body.

<BR>That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
<BR>What louring star now envies thy estate,
<BR>That these great lords and Margaret our queen
<BR>Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
<BR>Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
<BR>And as the butcher takes away the calf
<BR>And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
<BR>Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
<BR>Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
<BR>And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
<BR>Looking the way her harmless young one went,
<BR>And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
<BR>Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
<BR>With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
<BR>Look after him and cannot do him good,
<BR>So mighty are his vowed enemies.

<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET

<BR>With sorrow snares relenting passengers,
<BR>Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,
<BR>With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child

<BR>Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--

<BR>The king will labour still to save his life,
<BR>The commons haply rise, to save his life;

<BR>No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
<BR>By nature proved an enemy to the flock,
<BR>Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
<BR>As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
<BR>And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
<BR>Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
<BR>Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,

<BR>And find no harbour in a royal heart.
<BR>Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
<BR>on thought,
<BR>And not a thought but thinks on dignity.

<BR>Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,

<BR>'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:
<BR>I take it kindly; and yet be well assured

<BR>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
<BR>I will stir up in England some black storm
<BR>Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
<BR>And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
<BR>Until the golden circuit on my head,
<BR>Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
<BR>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
<BR>And, for a minister of my intent,
<BR>I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,
<BR>John Cade of Ashford,
<BR>To make commotion, as full well he can,
<BR>Under the title of John Mortimer.
<BR>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
<BR>Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
<BR>And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
<BR>Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;
<BR>And, in the end being rescued, I have seen
<BR>Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
<BR>Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
<BR>Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
<BR>Hath he conversed with the enemy,
<BR>And undiscover'd come to me again
<BR>And given me notice of their villanies.
<BR>This devil here shall be my substitute;
<BR>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
<BR>In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:
<BR>By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
<BR>How they affect the house and claim of York.
<BR>Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,
<BR>I know no pain they can inflict upon him
<BR>Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
<BR>Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,
<BR>Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
<BR>And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
<BR>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,

<BR>And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
<BR>Drove back again unto my native clime?
<BR>What boded this, but well forewarning wind
<BR>Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,

<BR>What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts
<BR>And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
<BR>And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
<BR>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
<BR>Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,
<BR>But left that hateful office unto thee:
<BR>The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,
<BR>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
<BR>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:
<BR>The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
<BR>And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
<BR>Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
<BR>Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
<BR>As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
<BR>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
<BR>I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
<BR>And when the dusky sky began to rob
<BR>My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
<BR>I took a costly jewel from my neck,
<BR>A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
<BR>And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,
<BR>And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
<BR>And even with this I lost fair England's view
<BR>And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
<BR>And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,
<BR>For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
<BR>How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
<BR>The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
<BR>To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
<BR>When he to madding Dido would unfold
<BR>His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!

<tr valign=top><td>WHITMORE

<BR>Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?

<BR>And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
<BR>How often hast thou waited at my cup,
<BR>Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
<BR>When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
<BR>Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,
<BR>Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;
<BR>How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
<BR>And duly waited for my coming forth?
<BR>This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,

<BR>Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;
<BR>And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,
<BR>Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
<BR>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
<BR>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
<BR>For daring to affy a mighty lord
<BR>Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
<BR>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
<BR>By devilish policy art thou grown great,
<BR>And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged
<BR>With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
<BR>By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
<BR>The false revolting Normans thorough thee
<BR>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
<BR>Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,
<BR>And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
<BR>The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
<BR>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
<BR>As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
<BR>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
<BR>By shameful murder of a guiltless king
<BR>And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
<BR>Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours
<BR>Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,
<BR>Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'
<BR>The commons here in Kent are up in arms:
<BR>And, to conclude, reproach and beggary

<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK

<BR>Far be it we should honour such as these
<BR>With humble suit: no, rather let my head

<BR>King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
<BR>Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
<BR>Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
<BR>That head of thine doth not become a crown;

<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD

<BR>What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,
<BR>And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
<BR>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
<BR>If it be banish'd from the frosty head,

<BR>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
<BR>And shame thine honourable age with blood?
<BR>Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
<BR>Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?
<BR>For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me

<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,

<BR>This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,
<BR>As on a mountain top the cedar shows
<BR>That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
