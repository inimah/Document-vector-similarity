<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter two Gentlemen]


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
<BR>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
<BR>Still seem as does the king.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>But what's the matter?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
<BR>He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
<BR>That late he married--hath referr'd herself
<BR>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
<BR>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
<BR>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
<BR>Be touch'd at very heart.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>None but the king?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
<BR>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
<BR>Although they wear their faces to the bent
<BR>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
<BR>Glad at the thing they scowl at.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>And why so?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
<BR>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
<BR>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
<BR>And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
<BR>As, to seek through the regions of the earth
<BR>For one his like, there would be something failing
<BR>In him that should compare. I do not think
<BR>So fair an outward and such stuff within
<BR>Endows a man but he.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>You speak him far.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>I do extend him, sir, within himself,
<BR>Crush him together rather than unfold
<BR>His measure duly.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>What's his name and birth?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>I cannot delve him to the root: his father
<BR>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
<BR>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
<BR>But had his titles by Tenantius whom
<BR>He served with glory and admired success,
<BR>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
<BR>And had, besides this gentleman in question,
<BR>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
<BR>Died with their swords in hand; for which
<BR>their father,
<BR>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
<BR>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
<BR>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
<BR>As he was born. The king he takes the babe
<BR>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
<BR>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
<BR>Puts to him all the learnings that his time
<BR>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
<BR>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
<BR>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
<BR>Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
<BR>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
<BR>A glass that feated them, and to the graver
<BR>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
<BR>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
<BR>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
<BR>By her election may be truly read
<BR>What kind of man he is.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I honour him
<BR>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
<BR>Is she sole child to the king?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>His only child.
<BR>He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
<BR>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
<BR>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
<BR>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
<BR>Which way they went.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>How long is this ago?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Some twenty years.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>That a king's children should be so convey'd,
<BR>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
<BR>That could not trace them!


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
<BR>Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
<BR>Yet is it true, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I do well believe you.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
<BR>The queen, and princess.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN]


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
<BR>After the slander of most stepmothers,
<BR>Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
<BR>Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
<BR>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
<BR>So soon as I can win the offended king,
<BR>I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
<BR>The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
<BR>You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
<BR>Your wisdom may inform you.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Please your highness,
<BR>I will from hence to-day.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>You know the peril.
<BR>I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
<BR>The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
<BR>Hath charged you should not speak together.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>O
<BR>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
<BR>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
<BR>I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
<BR>Always reserved my holy duty--what
<BR>His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
<BR>And I shall here abide the hourly shot
<BR>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
<BR>But that there is this jewel in the world
<BR>That I may see again.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>My queen! my mistress!
<BR>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
<BR>To be suspected of more tenderness
<BR>Than doth become a man. I will remain
<BR>The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
<BR>My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
<BR>Who to my father was a friend, to me
<BR>Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
<BR>And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
<BR>Though ink be made of gall.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter QUEEN]


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>Be brief, I pray you:
<BR>If the king come, I shall incur I know not
<BR>How much of his displeasure.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Yet I'll move him
<BR>To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
<BR>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
<BR>Pays dear for my offences.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Should we be taking leave
<BR>As long a term as yet we have to live,
<BR>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>Nay, stay a little:
<BR>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
<BR>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
<BR>This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
<BR>But keep it till you woo another wife,
<BR>When Imogen is dead.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>How, how! another?
<BR>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
<BR>And sear up my embracements from a next
<BR>With bonds of death!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Putting on the ring]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Remain, remain thou here
<BR>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
<BR>As I my poor self did exchange for you,
<BR>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
<BR>I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
<BR>It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
<BR>Upon this fairest prisoner.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Putting a bracelet upon her arm]


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>O the gods!
<BR>When shall we see again?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CYMBELINE and Lords]


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Alack, the king!


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
<BR>If after this command thou fraught the court
<BR>With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
<BR>Thou'rt poison to my blood.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>The gods protect you!
<BR>And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>There cannot be a pinch in death
<BR>More sharp than this is.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>O disloyal thing,
<BR>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
<BR>A year's age on me.


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>I beseech you, sir,
<BR>Harm not yourself with your vexation
<BR>I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
<BR>Subdues all pangs, all fears.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Past grace? obedience?


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
<BR>And did avoid a puttock.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
<BR>A seat for baseness.


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>No; I rather added
<BR>A lustre to it.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>O thou vile one!


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>Sir,
<BR>It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
<BR>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
<BR>A man worth any woman, overbuys me
<BR>Almost the sum he pays.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>What, art thou mad?


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
<BR>A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
<BR>Our neighbour shepherd's son!


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Thou foolish thing!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter QUEEN]

<tr valign=top><td><td>They were again together: you have done
<BR>Not after our command. Away with her,
<BR>And pen her up.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>Beseech your patience. Peace,
<BR>Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
<BR>Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
<BR>Out of your best advice.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Nay, let her languish
<BR>A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
<BR>Die of this folly!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords]


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>Fie! you must give way.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PISANIO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?


<tr valign=top><td>PISANIO
<td>My lord your son drew on my master.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>Ha!
<BR>No harm, I trust, is done?


<tr valign=top><td>PISANIO
<td>There might have been,
<BR>But that my master rather play'd than fought
<BR>And had no help of anger: they were parted
<BR>By gentlemen at hand.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>I am very glad on't.


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
<BR>To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
<BR>I would they were in Afric both together;
<BR>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
<BR>The goer-back. Why came you from your master?


<tr valign=top><td>PISANIO
<td>On his command: he would not suffer me
<BR>To bring him to the haven; left these notes
<BR>Of what commands I should be subject to,
<BR>When 't pleased you to employ me.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>This hath been
<BR>Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
<BR>He will remain so.


<tr valign=top><td>PISANIO
<td>I humbly thank your highness.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>Pray, walk awhile.


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>About some half-hour hence,
<BR>I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
<BR>Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

<tr valign=top><td>First Lord

<tr valign=top><td>CLOTEN

<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
<BR>not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord

<tr valign=top><td>CLOTEN

<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord

<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but

<BR>amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
<BR>knowing, to a stranger of his quality.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I beseech you all, be better known to this
<BR>gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
<BR>of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
<BR>hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.


<tr valign=top><td>Frenchman
<td>Sir, we have known together in Orleans.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
<BR>which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.


<tr valign=top><td>Frenchman
<td>Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
<BR>did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
<BR>you should have been put together with so mortal a
<BR>purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
<BR>slight and trivial a nature.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
<BR>rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
<BR>my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
<BR>but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
<BR>it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.


<tr valign=top><td>Frenchman
<td>'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
<BR>and by such two that would by all likelihood have
<BR>confounded one the other, or have fallen both.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?


<tr valign=top><td>Frenchman
<td>Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
<BR>which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
<BR>It was much like an argument that fell out last
<BR>night, where each of us fell in praise of our
<BR>country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
<BR>vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
<BR>affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
<BR>chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
<BR>than any the rarest of our ladies in France.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
<BR>opinion by this worn out.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>She holds her virtue still and I my mind.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
<BR>abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
<BR>adorer, not her friend.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
<BR>comparison--had been something too fair and too good
<BR>for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
<BR>I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
<BR>many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
<BR>excelled many: but I have not seen the most
<BR>precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>What do you esteem it at?


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>More than the world enjoys.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
<BR>outprized by a trifle.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
<BR>there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
<BR>for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
<BR>and only the gift of the gods.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>Which the gods have given you?


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Which, by their graces, I will keep.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
<BR>strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
<BR>ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
<BR>estimations; the one is but frail and the other
<BR>casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
<BR>courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
<BR>to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
<BR>holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
<BR>nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
<BR>notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.


<tr valign=top><td>PHILARIO
<td>Let us leave here, gentlemen.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
<BR>thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>With five times so much conversation, I should get
<BR>ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
<BR>to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>No, no.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
<BR>your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
<BR>something: but I make my wager rather against your
<BR>confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
<BR>offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
<BR>lady in the world.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>You are a great deal abused in too bold a
<BR>persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
<BR>worthy of by your attempt.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>What's that?


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
<BR>deserve more; a punishment too.


<tr valign=top><td>PHILARIO
<td>Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
<BR>let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
<BR>better acquainted.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
<BR>approbation of what I have spoke!


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>What lady would you choose to assail?


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
<BR>I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
<BR>that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
<BR>with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
<BR>second conference, and I will bring from thence
<BR>that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
<BR>I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
<BR>ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
<BR>preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
<BR>religion in you, that you fear.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
<BR>graver purpose, I hope.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
<BR>what's spoken, I swear.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
<BR>return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
<BR>mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
<BR>unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.


<tr valign=top><td>PHILARIO
<td>I will have it no lay.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
<BR>sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
<BR>bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
<BR>are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
<BR>and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
<BR>she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
<BR>yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
<BR>free entertainment.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
<BR>betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
<BR>you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
<BR>to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
<BR>your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
<BR>remain unseduced, you not making it appear
<BR>otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
<BR>have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
<BR>your sword.


<tr valign=top><td>IACHIMO
<td>Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
<BR>down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
<BR>Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
<BR>starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
<BR>wagers recorded.


<tr valign=top><td>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
<td>Agreed.

<BR>Which are the movers of a languishing death;
<BR>But though slow, deadly?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN
<td>I wonder, doctor,
<BR>Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been

<BR>That I did amplify my judgment in
<BR>Other conclusions? I will try the forces
<BR>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
<BR>We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
<BR>To try the vigour of them and apply
<BR>Allayments to their act, and by them gather
<BR>Their several virtues and effects.


<tr valign=top><td>CORNELIUS
<td>Your highness
<BR>Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:

<BR>As great as is thy master, greater, for
<BR>His fortunes all lie speechless and his name

<BR>As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
<BR>With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
<BR>With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
<BR>But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
<BR>Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
<BR>Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
<BR>That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
<BR>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--

<BR>The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
<BR>Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:
<BR>Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
<BR>As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
<BR>Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
<BR>Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
<BR>Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
<BR>Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
<BR>Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
<BR>You made great Juno angry.


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN

<BR>A man already.

<tr valign=top><td>PISANIO
<td>My lord,
<BR>Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
<BR>Upon my lady's missing, came to me
<BR>With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
<BR>If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
<BR>It was my instant death. By accident,
<BR>had a feigned letter of my master's
<BR>Then in my pocket; which directed him
<BR>To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
<BR>Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
<BR>Which he enforced from me, away he posts
<BR>With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
<BR>My lady's honour: what became of him
<BR>I further know not.

<BR>With language that would make me spurn the sea,
<BR>If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
<BR>And am right glad he is not standing here
<BR>To tell this tale of mine.

<tr valign=top><td>ARVIRAGUS

<tr valign=top><td>BELARIUS

<BR>As I have received it.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Nursing of my sons!


<tr valign=top><td>BELARIUS
<td>I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
<BR>Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
<BR>Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
<BR>These two young gentlemen, that call me father
<BR>And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
<BR>They are the issue of your loins, my liege,

<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>How! my issue!


<tr valign=top><td>BELARIUS
<td>So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
<BR>Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
<BR>Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
<BR>Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
<BR>Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
<BR>For such and so they are--these twenty years
<BR>Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
<BR>Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
<BR>Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
<BR>Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
<BR>Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
<BR>Having received the punishment before,
<BR>For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
<BR>Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
<BR>The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
<BR>Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
<BR>Here are your sons again; and I must lose
<BR>Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
<BR>The benediction of these covering heavens
<BR>Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
<BR>To inlay heaven with stars.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE

<BR>The service that you three have done is more
<BR>Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
<BR>If these be they, I know not how to wish
<BR>A pair of worthier sons.


<tr valign=top><td>BELARIUS
<td>Be pleased awhile.
<BR>This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
<BR>Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
<BR>This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
<BR>Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
<BR>In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
<BR>Of his queen mother, which for more probation
<BR>I can with ease produce.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Guiderius had
<BR>Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
<BR>It was a mark of wonder.


<tr valign=top><td>BELARIUS
<td>This is he;
<BR>Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
<BR>It was wise nature's end in the donation,
<BR>To be his evidence now.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>O, what, am I
<BR>A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
<BR>Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
<BR>That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
<BR>may reign in them now! O Imogen,
<BR>Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.


<tr valign=top><td>IMOGEN
<td>No, my lord;
<BR>I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
<BR>Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
<BR>But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
<BR>When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
<BR>When ye were so indeed.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE

<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>O rare instinct!
<BR>When shall I hear all through? This fierce
<BR>abridgement
<BR>Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
<BR>Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
<BR>And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
<BR>How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
<BR>Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
<BR>And your three motives to the battle, with
<BR>I know not how much more, should be demanded;
<BR>And all the other by-dependencies,
<BR>From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
<BR>Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
<BR>Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
<BR>And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
<BR>On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
<BR>Each object with a joy: the counterchange
<BR>Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,

<BR>shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
<BR>years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
<BR>stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
<BR>his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in

<BR>Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To CYMBELINE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
<BR>Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'

<BR>Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
<BR>Answering the letter of the oracle,
<BR>Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about

<td>This hath some seeming.

<BR>Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
<BR>For many years thought dead, are now revived,
<BR>To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
<BR>Promises Britain peace and plenty.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Well
<BR>My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
<BR>Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
<BR>And to the Roman empire; promising
<BR>To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
<BR>We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
<BR>Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
<BR>Have laid most heavy hand.


<tr valign=top><td>Soothsayer
<td>The fingers of the powers above do tune
<BR>The harmony of this peace. The vision
<BR>Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
<BR>Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
<BR>Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
<BR>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
<BR>Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
<BR>So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
<BR>The imperial Caesar, should again unite
<BR>His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
<BR>Which shines here in the west.


<tr valign=top><td>CYMBELINE
<td>Laud we the gods;
<BR>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
<BR>From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
<BR>To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
<BR>A Roman and a British ensign wave
<BR>Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
<BR>And in the temple of great Jupiter
<BR>Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
<BR>Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
