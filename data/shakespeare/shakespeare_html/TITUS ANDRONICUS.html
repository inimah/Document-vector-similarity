<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
<BR>Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
<BR>And, countrymen, my loving followers,
<BR>Plead my successive title with your swords:
<BR>I am his first-born son, that was the last
<BR>That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
<BR>Then let my father's honours live in me,
<BR>Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSIANUS
<td>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
<BR>If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
<BR>Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
<BR>Keep then this passage to the Capitol
<BR>And suffer not dishonour to approach
<BR>The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
<BR>To justice, continence and nobility;
<BR>But let desert in pure election shine,
<BR>And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown]


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
<BR>Ambitiously for rule and empery,
<BR>Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
<BR>A special party, have, by common voice,
<BR>In election for the Roman empery,
<BR>Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
<BR>For many good and great deserts to Rome:
<BR>A nobler man, a braver warrior,
<BR>Lives not this day within the city walls:
<BR>He by the senate is accit'd home
<BR>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
<BR>That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
<BR>Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
<BR>Ten years are spent since first he undertook
<BR>This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
<BR>Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
<BR>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
<BR>In coffins from the field;
<BR>And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,
<BR>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
<BR>Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
<BR>Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
<BR>Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
<BR>And in the Capitol and senate's right,
<BR>Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
<BR>That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
<BR>Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
<BR>Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!


<tr valign=top><td>BASSIANUS
<td>Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally
<BR>In thy uprightness and integrity,
<BR>And so I love and honour thee and thine,
<BR>Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
<BR>And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
<BR>Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
<BR>That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
<BR>And to my fortunes and the people's favor
<BR>Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.

<td>Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
<BR>I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
<BR>And to the love and favor of my country
<BR>Commit myself, my person and the cause.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS]

<BR>As I am confident and kind to thee.

<BR>Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
<BR>Successful in the battles that he fights,
<BR>With honour and with fortune is return'd
<BR>From where he circumscribed with his sword,
<BR>And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and

<BR>them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with
<BR>ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,
<BR>prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The
<BR>Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks]


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
<BR>Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
<BR>Returns with precious jading to the bay
<BR>From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
<BR>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
<BR>To re-salute his country with his tears,
<BR>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
<BR>Thou great defender of this Capitol,
<BR>Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
<BR>Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
<BR>Half of the number that King Priam had,
<BR>Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
<BR>These that survive let Rome reward with love;
<BR>These that I bring unto their latest home,
<BR>With burial amongst their ancestors:
<BR>Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
<BR>Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
<BR>Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
<BR>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
<BR>Make way to lay them by their brethren.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[The tomb is opened]

<tr valign=top><td><td>There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
<BR>And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
<BR>O sacred receptacle of my joys,
<BR>Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
<BR>How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
<BR>That thou wilt never render to me more!


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
<BR>That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
<BR>Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
<BR>Before this earthy prison of their bones;
<BR>That so the shadows be not unappeased,
<BR>Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>I give him you, the noblest that survives,
<BR>The eldest son of this distressed queen.


<tr valign=top><td>TAMORA
<td>Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
<BR>Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
<BR>A mother's tears in passion for her son:
<BR>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
<BR>O, think my son to be as dear to me!
<BR>Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
<BR>To beautify thy triumphs and return,
<BR>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
<BR>But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,
<BR>For valiant doings in their country's cause?
<BR>O, if to fight for king and commonweal
<BR>Were piety in thine, it is in these.
<BR>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
<BR>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
<BR>Draw near them then in being merciful:
<BR>Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
<BR>Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
<BR>These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld
<BR>Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
<BR>Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
<BR>To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
<BR>To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Away with him! and make a fire straight;
<BR>And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
<BR>Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS]


<tr valign=top><td>TAMORA
<td>O cruel, irreligious piety!


<tr valign=top><td>CHIRON
<td>Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?


<tr valign=top><td>DEMETRIUS
<td>Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
<BR>Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
<BR>To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
<BR>Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
<BR>The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
<BR>With opportunity of sharp revenge
<BR>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
<BR>May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--
<BR>When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
<BR>To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with
<BR>their swords bloody]


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
<BR>Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
<BR>And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
<BR>Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
<BR>Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,
<BR>And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Let it be so; and let Andronicus
<BR>Make this his latest farewell to their souls.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb]

<tr valign=top><td><td>In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
<BR>Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
<BR>Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
<BR>Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
<BR>Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
<BR>No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
<BR>In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LAVINIA]


<tr valign=top><td>LAVINIA
<td>In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
<BR>My noble lord and father, live in fame!
<BR>Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
<BR>I render, for my brethren's obsequies;
<BR>And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,
<BR>Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
<BR>O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
<BR>Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
<BR>The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
<BR>Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
<BR>And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;
<BR>re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended]


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
<BR>Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
<BR>You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
<BR>Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
<BR>That in your country's service drew your swords:
<BR>But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
<BR>That hath aspired to Solon's happiness
<BR>And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
<BR>Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
<BR>Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
<BR>Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
<BR>This palliament of white and spotless hue;
<BR>And name thee in election for the empire,
<BR>With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
<BR>Be candidatus then, and put it on,
<BR>And help to set a head on headless Rome.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>A better head her glorious body fits
<BR>Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
<BR>What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
<BR>Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
<BR>To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
<BR>And set abroad new business for you all?
<BR>Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
<BR>And led my country's strength successfully,
<BR>And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
<BR>Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
<BR>In right and service of their noble country
<BR>Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
<BR>But not a sceptre to control the world:
<BR>Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Patience, Prince Saturninus.


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>Romans, do me right:
<BR>Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
<BR>Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
<BR>Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
<BR>Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
<BR>That noble-minded Titus means to thee!


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
<BR>The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSIANUS
<td>Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
<BR>But honour thee, and will do till I die:
<BR>My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
<BR>I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
<BR>Of noble minds is honourable meed.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
<BR>I ask your voices and your suffrages:
<BR>Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?


<tr valign=top><td>Tribunes
<td>To gratify the good Andronicus,
<BR>And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
<BR>The people will accept whom he admits.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,
<BR>That you create your emperor's eldest son,
<BR>Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
<BR>Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
<BR>And ripen justice in this commonweal:
<BR>Then, if you will elect by my advice,
<BR>Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>With voices and applause of every sort,
<BR>Patricians and plebeians, we create
<BR>Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
<BR>And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'

<tr valign=top><td><td>[A long flourish till they come down]


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done
<BR>To us in our election this day,
<BR>I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
<BR>And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
<BR>And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
<BR>Thy name and honourable family,
<BR>Lavinia will I make my empress,
<BR>Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
<BR>And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:
<BR>Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
<BR>I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
<BR>And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
<BR>King and commander of our commonweal,
<BR>The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
<BR>My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;
<BR>Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
<BR>Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
<BR>Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
<BR>How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
<BR>Rome shall record, and when I do forget
<BR>The least of these unspeakable deserts,
<BR>Romans, forget your fealty to me.


<tr valign=top><td>TITUS ANDRONICUS
<td>[To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to
<BR>an emperor;
<BR>To him that, for your honour and your state,
<BR>Will use you nobly and your followers.


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
<BR>That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
<BR>Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
<BR>Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
<BR>Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:
<BR>Princely shall be thy usage every way.
<BR>Rest on my word, and let not discontent
<BR>Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
<BR>Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
<BR>Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?


<tr valign=top><td>LAVINIA

<BR>Warrants these words in princely courtesy.


<tr valign=top><td>SATURNINUS
<td>Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;

<BR>Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,

<BR>'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
<BR>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
<BR>Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
<BR>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
<BR>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
<BR>They never do beget a coal-black calf.
<BR>Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
<BR>the babe,--
<BR>'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
<BR>Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
<BR>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
<BR>With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
<BR>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
<BR>To use as you think needful of the man.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
<BR>That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
<BR>This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,
<BR>And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
<BR>Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
<BR>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
<BR>Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
<BR>A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
<BR>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.


<tr valign=top><td>AARON

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS

<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>Lucius, save the child,
<BR>And bear it from me to the empress.
<BR>If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
<BR>That highly may advantage thee to hear:
<BR>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
<BR>I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
<BR>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.


<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
<BR>'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
<BR>For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
<BR>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
<BR>Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
<BR>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
<BR>And this shall all be buried by my death,
<BR>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.


<tr valign=top><td>AARON

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
<BR>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?


<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
<BR>Yet, for I know thou art religious
<BR>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
<BR>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
<BR>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
<BR>Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
<BR>An idiot holds his bauble for a god
<BR>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
<BR>To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
<BR>By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
<BR>That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
<BR>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
<BR>Or else I will discover nought to thee.

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS

<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
<BR>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
<BR>'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
<BR>They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
<BR>And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?


<tr valign=top><td>AARON

<BR>Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!


<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
<BR>That codding spirit had they from their mother,
<BR>As sure a card as ever won the set;
<BR>That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
<BR>As true a dog as ever fought at head.
<BR>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
<BR>I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
<BR>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
<BR>I wrote the letter that thy father found
<BR>And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
<BR>Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
<BR>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
<BR>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
<BR>I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
<BR>And, when I had it, drew myself apart
<BR>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
<BR>I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
<BR>When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
<BR>Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
<BR>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
<BR>And when I told the empress of this sport,
<BR>She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
<BR>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.


<tr valign=top><td>First Goth
<td>What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?


<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?


<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
<BR>Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
<BR>Few come within the compass of my curse,--
<BR>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
<BR>As kill a man, or else devise his death,
<BR>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
<BR>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
<BR>Set deadly enmity between two friends,
<BR>Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
<BR>Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
<BR>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
<BR>Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
<BR>And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
<BR>Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
<BR>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
<BR>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
<BR>'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
<BR>Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
<BR>As willingly as one would kill a fly,
<BR>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
<BR>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

<td>You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
<BR>By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
<BR>Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
<BR>O, let me teach you how to knit again
<BR>This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
<BR>These broken limbs again into one body;
<BR>Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
<BR>And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
<BR>Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
<BR>Do shameful execution on herself.
<BR>But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
<BR>Grave witnesses of true experience,
<BR>Cannot induce you to attend my words,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To LUCIUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
<BR>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
<BR>To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
<BR>The story of that baleful burning night
<BR>When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
<BR>Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
<BR>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
<BR>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
<BR>My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
<BR>Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
<BR>But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
<BR>And break my utterance, even in the time
<BR>When it should move you to attend me most,
<BR>Lending your kind commiseration.
<BR>Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
<BR>Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
<BR>That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
<BR>Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
<BR>And they it were that ravished our sister:
<BR>For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
<BR>Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd
<BR>Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
<BR>And sent her enemies unto the grave.
<BR>Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
<BR>The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
<BR>To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
<BR>Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
<BR>And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
<BR>I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
<BR>That have preserved her welfare in my blood;
<BR>And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
<BR>Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
<BR>Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
<BR>My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
<BR>That my report is just and full of truth.
<BR>But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
<BR>Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
<BR>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Of this was Tamora delivered;
<BR>The issue of an irreligious Moor,
<BR>Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
<BR>The villain is alive in Titus' house,
<BR>And as he is, to witness this is true.
<BR>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
<BR>These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
<BR>Or more than any living man could bear.
<BR>Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
<BR>Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
<BR>And, from the place where you behold us now,
<BR>The poor remainder of Andronici
<BR>Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
<BR>And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
<BR>And make a mutual closure of our house.
<BR>Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
<BR>Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.


<tr valign=top><td>AEMILIUS
<td>Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
<BR>And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
<BR>Lucius our emperor; for well I know
<BR>The common voice do cry it shall be so.


<tr valign=top><td>All
<td>Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To Attendants]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
<BR>To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,
<BR>As punishment for his most wicked life.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Attendants]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend]


<tr valign=top><td>All

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
<BR>To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
<BR>But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
<BR>For nature puts me to a heavy task:
<BR>Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
<BR>To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
<BR>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Kissing TITUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
<BR>The last true duties of thy noble son!


<tr valign=top><td>MARCUS ANDRONICUS
<td>Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
<BR>Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
<BR>O were the sum of these that I should pay
<BR>Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
<BR>To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
<BR>Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
<BR>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
<BR>Many a matter hath he told to thee,
<BR>Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
<BR>In that respect, then, like a loving child,
<BR>Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
<BR>Because kind nature doth require it so:
<BR>Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
<BR>Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
<BR>Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.


<tr valign=top><td>Young LUCIUS
<td>O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
<BR>Would I were dead, so you did live again!
<BR>O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
<BR>My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Attendants with AARON]


<tr valign=top><td>AEMILIUS
<td>You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
<BR>Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
<BR>That hath been breeder of these dire events.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
<BR>There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
<BR>If any one relieves or pities him,
<BR>For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
<BR>Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.


<tr valign=top><td>AARON
<td>O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
<BR>I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
<BR>I should repent the evils I have done:
<BR>Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
<BR>Would I perform, if I might have my will;
<BR>If one good deed in all my life I did,
<BR>I do repent it from my very soul.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS
<td>Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
<BR>And give him burial in his father's grave:
<BR>My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
<BR>Be closed in our household's monument.
<BR>As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
<BR>No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,
<BR>No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
<BR>But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
<BR>Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
<BR>And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
<BR>See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
<BR>By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
<BR>Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
<BR>That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
