<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY]


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
<BR>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
<BR>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
<BR>But that the scambling and unquiet time
<BR>Did push it out of farther question.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
<BR>We lose the better half of our possession:
<BR>For all the temporal lands which men devout
<BR>By testament have given to the church
<BR>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
<BR>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
<BR>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
<BR>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
<BR>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
<BR>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
<BR>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
<BR>And to the coffers of the king beside,
<BR>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>This would drink deep.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>'Twould drink the cup and all.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>But what prevention?


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>The king is full of grace and fair regard.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>And a true lover of the holy church.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>The courses of his youth promised it not.
<BR>The breath no sooner left his father's body,
<BR>But that his wildness, mortified in him,
<BR>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
<BR>Consideration, like an angel, came
<BR>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
<BR>Leaving his body as a paradise,
<BR>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
<BR>Never was such a sudden scholar made;
<BR>Never came reformation in a flood,
<BR>With such a heady currance, scouring faults
<BR>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
<BR>So soon did lose his seat and all at once
<BR>As in this king.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>We are blessed in the change.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>Hear him but reason in divinity,
<BR>And all-admiring with an inward wish
<BR>You would desire the king were made a prelate:
<BR>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
<BR>You would say it hath been all in all his study:
<BR>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
<BR>A fearful battle render'd you in music:
<BR>Turn him to any cause of policy,
<BR>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
<BR>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
<BR>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
<BR>And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
<BR>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
<BR>So that the art and practic part of life
<BR>Must be the mistress to this theoric:
<BR>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
<BR>Since his addiction was to courses vain,
<BR>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
<BR>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
<BR>And never noted in him any study,
<BR>Any retirement, any sequestration
<BR>From open haunts and popularity.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
<BR>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
<BR>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
<BR>And so the prince obscured his contemplation
<BR>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
<BR>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
<BR>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
<BR>And therefore we must needs admit the means
<BR>How things are perfected.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>But, my good lord,
<BR>How now for mitigation of this bill
<BR>Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
<BR>Incline to it, or no?


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>He seems indifferent,
<BR>Or rather swaying more upon our part
<BR>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
<BR>For I have made an offer to his majesty,
<BR>Upon our spiritual convocation
<BR>And in regard of causes now in hand,
<BR>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
<BR>As touching France, to give a greater sum
<BR>Than ever at one time the clergy yet
<BR>Did to his predecessors part withal.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>How did this offer seem received, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>With good acceptance of his majesty;
<BR>Save that there was not time enough to hear,
<BR>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
<BR>The severals and unhidden passages
<BR>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
<BR>And generally to the crown and seat of France
<BR>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>What was the impediment that broke this off?


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>The French ambassador upon that instant
<BR>Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
<BR>To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>It is.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>Then go we in, to know his embassy;
<BR>Which I could with a ready guess declare,
<BR>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER,
<BR>WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<BR>Before we hear him, of some things of weight
<BR>That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY]


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>God and his angels guard your sacred throne
<BR>And make you long become it!


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Sure, we thank you.
<BR>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
<BR>And justly and religiously unfold
<BR>Why the law Salique that they have in France
<BR>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
<BR>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
<BR>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
<BR>Or nicely charge your understanding soul
<BR>With opening titles miscreate, whose right
<BR>Suits not in native colours with the truth;
<BR>For God doth know how many now in health
<BR>Shall drop their blood in approbation
<BR>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
<BR>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
<BR>How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
<BR>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
<BR>For never two such kingdoms did contend
<BR>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
<BR>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
<BR>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
<BR>That make such waste in brief mortality.
<BR>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
<BR>For we will hear, note and believe in heart
<BR>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
<BR>As pure as sin with baptism.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
<BR>That owe yourselves, your lives and services
<BR>To this imperial throne. There is no bar
<BR>To make against your highness' claim to France
<BR>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
<BR>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
<BR>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
<BR>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
<BR>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
<BR>The founder of this law and female bar.
<BR>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
<BR>That the land Salique is in Germany,
<BR>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
<BR>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
<BR>There left behind and settled certain French;
<BR>Who, holding in disdain the German women
<BR>For some dishonest manners of their life,
<BR>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
<BR>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
<BR>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
<BR>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
<BR>Then doth it well appear that Salique law
<BR>Was not devised for the realm of France:
<BR>Nor did the French possess the Salique land
<BR>Until four hundred one and twenty years
<BR>After defunction of King Pharamond,
<BR>Idly supposed the founder of this law;
<BR>Who died within the year of our redemption
<BR>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
<BR>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
<BR>Beyond the river Sala, in the year
<BR>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
<BR>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
<BR>Did, as heir general, being descended
<BR>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
<BR>Make claim and title to the crown of France.
<BR>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
<BR>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
<BR>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
<BR>To find his title with some shows of truth,
<BR>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
<BR>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
<BR>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
<BR>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
<BR>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
<BR>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
<BR>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
<BR>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
<BR>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
<BR>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
<BR>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
<BR>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
<BR>Was re-united to the crown of France.
<BR>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
<BR>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
<BR>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
<BR>To hold in right and title of the female:
<BR>So do the kings of France unto this day;
<BR>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
<BR>To bar your highness claiming from the female,
<BR>And rather choose to hide them in a net
<BR>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
<BR>Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>May I with right and conscience make this claim?


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
<BR>For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
<BR>When the man dies, let the inheritance
<BR>Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
<BR>Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
<BR>Look back into your mighty ancestors:
<BR>Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
<BR>From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
<BR>And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
<BR>Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
<BR>Making defeat on the full power of France,
<BR>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
<BR>Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
<BR>Forage in blood of French nobility.
<BR>O noble English. that could entertain
<BR>With half their forces the full Pride of France
<BR>And let another half stand laughing by,
<BR>All out of work and cold for action!


<tr valign=top><td>ELY
<td>Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
<BR>And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
<BR>You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
<BR>The blood and courage that renowned them
<BR>Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
<BR>Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
<BR>Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
<BR>Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
<BR>As did the former lions of your blood.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
<BR>So hath your highness; never king of England
<BR>Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
<BR>Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
<BR>And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
<BR>With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
<BR>In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
<BR>Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
<BR>As never did the clergy at one time
<BR>Bring in to any of your ancestors.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>We must not only arm to invade the French,
<BR>But lay down our proportions to defend
<BR>Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
<BR>With all advantages.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
<BR>Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
<BR>Our inland from the pilfering borderers.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
<BR>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
<BR>Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
<BR>For you shall read that my great-grandfather
<BR>Never went with his forces into France
<BR>But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
<BR>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
<BR>With ample and brim fulness of his force,
<BR>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
<BR>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
<BR>That England, being empty of defence,
<BR>Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
<BR>For hear her but exampled by herself:
<BR>When all her chivalry hath been in France
<BR>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
<BR>She hath herself not only well defended
<BR>But taken and impounded as a stray
<BR>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
<BR>To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
<BR>And make her chronicle as rich with praise
<BR>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
<BR>With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>But there's a saying very old and true,
<BR>'If that you will France win,
<BR>Then with Scotland first begin:'
<BR>For once the eagle England being in prey,
<BR>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
<BR>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
<BR>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
<BR>To tear and havoc more than she can eat.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>It follows then the cat must stay at home:
<BR>Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
<BR>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
<BR>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
<BR>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
<BR>The advised head defends itself at home;
<BR>For government, though high and low and lower,
<BR>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
<BR>Congreeing in a full and natural close,
<BR>Like music.


<tr valign=top><td>CANTERBURY
<td>Therefore doth heaven divide
<BR>The state of man in divers functions,
<BR>Setting endeavour in continual motion;
<BR>To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
<BR>Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
<BR>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
<BR>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
<BR>They have a king and officers of sorts;
<BR>Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
<BR>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
<BR>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
<BR>Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
<BR>Which pillage they with merry march bring home
<BR>To the tent-royal of their emperor;
<BR>Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
<BR>The singing masons building roofs of gold,
<BR>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
<BR>The poor mechanic porters crowding in
<BR>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
<BR>The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
<BR>Delivering o'er to executors pale
<BR>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
<BR>That many things, having full reference
<BR>To one consent, may work contrariously:
<BR>As many arrows, loosed several ways,
<BR>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
<BR>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
<BR>As many lines close in the dial's centre;
<BR>So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
<BR>End in one purpose, and be all well borne
<BR>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
<BR>Divide your happy England into four;
<BR>Whereof take you one quarter into France,
<BR>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
<BR>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
<BR>Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
<BR>Let us be worried and our nation lose
<BR>The name of hardiness and policy.

<tr valign=top><td>First Ambassador
<td>May't please your majesty to give us leave
<BR>Freely to render what we have in charge;
<BR>Or shall we sparingly show you far off
<BR>The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
<BR>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
<BR>As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
<BR>Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
<BR>Tell us the Dauphin's mind.


<tr valign=top><td>First Ambassador
<td>Thus, then, in few.
<BR>Your highness, lately sending into France,
<BR>Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
<BR>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
<BR>In answer of which claim, the prince our master
<BR>Says that you savour too much of your youth,
<BR>And bids you be advised there's nought in France
<BR>That can be with a nimble galliard won;
<BR>You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
<BR>He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
<BR>This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
<BR>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
<BR>Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>What treasure, uncle?


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Tennis-balls, my liege.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
<BR>His present and your pains we thank you for:
<BR>When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
<BR>We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
<BR>Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
<BR>Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
<BR>That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
<BR>With chaces. And we understand him well,
<BR>How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
<BR>Not measuring what use we made of them.
<BR>We never valued this poor seat of England;
<BR>And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
<BR>To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
<BR>That men are merriest when they are from home.
<BR>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
<BR>Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
<BR>When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
<BR>For that I have laid by my majesty
<BR>And plodded like a man for working-days,
<BR>But I will rise there with so full a glory
<BR>That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
<BR>Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
<BR>And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
<BR>Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
<BR>Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
<BR>That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
<BR>Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
<BR>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
<BR>And some are yet ungotten and unborn
<BR>That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
<BR>But this lies all within the will of God,
<BR>To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
<BR>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
<BR>To venge me as I may and to put forth
<BR>My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
<BR>So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
<BR>His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
<BR>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
<BR>Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Ambassadors]


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>This was a merry message.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<BR>Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
<BR>That may give furtherance to our expedition;
<BR>For we have now no thought in us but France,
<BR>Save those to God, that run before our business.
<BR>Therefore let our proportions for these wars
<BR>Be soon collected and all things thought upon
<BR>That may with reasonable swiftness add

<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE
<td>Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
<BR>And more than carefully it us concerns
<BR>To answer royally in our defences.
<BR>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
<BR>Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
<BR>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
<BR>To line and new repair our towns of war
<BR>With men of courage and with means defendant;
<BR>For England his approaches makes as fierce
<BR>As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
<BR>It fits us then to be as provident
<BR>As fear may teach us out of late examples
<BR>Left by the fatal and neglected English
<BR>Upon our fields.


<tr valign=top><td>DAUPHIN
<td>My most redoubted father,
<BR>It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
<BR>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
<BR>Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
<BR>But that defences, musters, preparations,
<BR>Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
<BR>As were a war in expectation.
<BR>Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
<BR>To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
<BR>And let us do it with no show of fear;
<BR>No, with no more than if we heard that England
<BR>Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
<BR>For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
<BR>Her sceptre so fantastically borne
<BR>By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
<BR>That fear attends her not.


<tr valign=top><td>Constable
<td>O peace, Prince Dauphin!
<BR>You are too much mistaken in this king:
<BR>Question your grace the late ambassadors,
<BR>With what great state he heard their embassy,
<BR>How well supplied with noble counsellors,
<BR>How modest in exception, and withal
<BR>How terrible in constant resolution,
<BR>And you shall find his vanities forespent
<BR>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
<BR>Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
<BR>As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
<BR>That shall first spring and be most delicate.


<tr valign=top><td>DAUPHIN
<td>Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
<BR>But though we think it so, it is no matter:
<BR>In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
<BR>The enemy more mighty than he seems:
<BR>So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
<BR>Which of a weak or niggardly projection
<BR>Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
<BR>A little cloth.


<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE
<td>Think we King Harry strong;
<BR>And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
<BR>The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
<BR>And he is bred out of that bloody strain
<BR>That haunted us in our familiar paths:
<BR>Witness our too much memorable shame
<BR>When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
<BR>And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
<BR>Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
<BR>Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
<BR>Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
<BR>Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,
<BR>Mangle the work of nature and deface
<BR>The patterns that by God and by French fathers
<BR>Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
<BR>Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
<BR>The native mightiness and fate of him.

<BR>And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
<BR>By custom and the ordinance of times
<BR>Unto the crown of France. That you may know
<BR>'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
<BR>Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
<BR>Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
<BR>He sends you this most memorable line,
<BR>In every branch truly demonstrative;
<BR>Willing to overlook this pedigree:
<BR>And when you find him evenly derived
<BR>From his most famed of famous ancestors,
<BR>Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
<BR>Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
<BR>From him the native and true challenger.


<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE
<td>Or else what follows?


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
<BR>Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
<BR>Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
<BR>In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
<BR>That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
<BR>And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
<BR>Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
<BR>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
<BR>Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
<BR>Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
<BR>The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
<BR>For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
<BR>That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
<BR>This is his claim, his threatening and my message;
<BR>Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
<BR>To whom expressly I bring greeting too.


<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE

<BR>He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,

<BR>Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
<BR>In second accent of his ordnance.


<tr valign=top><td>DAUPHIN

<BR>Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
<BR>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
<BR>My army but a weak and sickly guard;
<BR>Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
<BR>Though France himself and such another neighbour
<BR>Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
<BR>Go bid thy master well advise himself:
<BR>If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,

<tr valign=top><td>Chorus
<td>Now entertain conjecture of a time
<BR>When creeping murmur and the poring dark
<BR>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
<BR>From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
<BR>The hum of either army stilly sounds,
<BR>That the fixed sentinels almost receive
<BR>The secret whispers of each other's watch:
<BR>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
<BR>Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
<BR>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
<BR>Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
<BR>The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
<BR>With busy hammers closing rivets up,
<BR>Give dreadful note of preparation:
<BR>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
<BR>And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
<BR>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
<BR>The confident and over-lusty French
<BR>Do the low-rated English play at dice;
<BR>And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
<BR>Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
<BR>So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
<BR>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
<BR>Sit patiently and inly ruminate
<BR>The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
<BR>Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
<BR>Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
<BR>So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
<BR>The royal captain of this ruin'd band
<BR>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
<BR>Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
<BR>For forth he goes and visits all his host.
<BR>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
<BR>And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
<BR>Upon his royal face there is no note
<BR>How dread an army hath enrounded him;
<BR>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
<BR>Unto the weary and all-watched night,
<BR>But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
<BR>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
<BR>That every wretch, pining and pale before,
<BR>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
<BR>A largess universal like the sun
<BR>His liberal eye doth give to every one,
<BR>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
<BR>Behold, as may unworthiness define,
<BR>A little touch of Harry in the night.
<BR>And so our scene must to the battle fly;
<BR>Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
<BR>With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
<BR>Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
<BR>The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
<BR>Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
<BR>washed off the next tide.


<tr valign=top><td>BATES
<td>He hath not told his thought to the king?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I
<BR>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
<BR>am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
<BR>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
<BR>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
<BR>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and
<BR>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
<BR>yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
<BR>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
<BR>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
<BR>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
<BR>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
<BR>it, should dishearten his army.


<tr valign=top><td>BATES
<td>He may show what outward courage he will; but I
<BR>believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
<BR>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
<BR>were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:
<BR>I think he would not wish himself any where but
<BR>where he is.


<tr valign=top><td>BATES
<td>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
<BR>sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
<BR>alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
<BR>minds: methinks I could not die any where so
<BR>contented as in the king's company; his cause being
<BR>just and his quarrel honourable.


<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS
<td>That's more than we know.


<tr valign=top><td>BATES
<td>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
<BR>enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
<BR>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
<BR>the crime of it out of us.


<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS
<td>But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath
<BR>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
<BR>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
<BR>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
<BR>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a
<BR>surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
<BR>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
<BR>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
<BR>well that die in a battle; for how can they
<BR>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
<BR>argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
<BR>will be a black matter for the king that led them to
<BR>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
<BR>subjection.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>So, if a son that is by his father sent about
<BR>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
<BR>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
<BR>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
<BR>servant, under his master's command transporting a
<BR>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
<BR>many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
<BR>business of the master the author of the servant's
<BR>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
<BR>bound to answer the particular endings of his
<BR>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
<BR>his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
<BR>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
<BR>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
<BR>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
<BR>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
<BR>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
<BR>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
<BR>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
<BR>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
<BR>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
<BR>defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
<BR>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
<BR>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
<BR>so that here men are punished for before-breach of
<BR>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
<BR>they feared the death, they have borne life away;
<BR>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
<BR>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
<BR>their damnation than he was before guilty of those
<BR>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
<BR>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
<BR>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
<BR>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
<BR>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
<BR>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
<BR>blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
<BR>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
<BR>that, making God so free an offer, He let him
<BR>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
<BR>others how they should prepare.


<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS
<td>'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon
<BR>his own head, the king is not to answer it.


<tr valign=top><td>BATES
<td>But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
<BR>yet I determine to fight lustily for him.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.


<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS
<td>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but
<BR>when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
<BR>ne'er the wiser.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.


<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS
<td>You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
<BR>elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
<BR>do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
<BR>turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
<BR>peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
<BR>after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Your reproof is something too round: I should be
<BR>angry with you, if the time were convenient.


<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS
<td>Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS

<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS

<tr valign=top><td>WILLIAMS

<BR>His bruised helmet and his bended sword
<BR>Before him through the city: he forbids it,

<BR>As, by a lower but loving likelihood,

<BR>As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
<BR>Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
<BR>How many would the peaceful city quit,
<BR>To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
<BR>Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;
<BR>As yet the lamentation of the French
<BR>Invites the King of England's stay at home;
<BR>The emperor's coming in behalf of France,
<BR>To order peace between them; and omit

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Fair Katharine, and most fair,
<BR>Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
<BR>Such as will enter at a lady's ear
<BR>And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with
<BR>your French heart, I will be glad to hear you
<BR>confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do
<BR>you like me, Kate?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?


<tr valign=top><td>ALICE
<td>Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to
<BR>affirm it.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de
<BR>tromperies.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men
<BR>are full of deceits?


<tr valign=top><td>ALICE
<td>Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
<BR>deceits: dat is de princess.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,
<BR>Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am
<BR>glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if
<BR>thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king
<BR>that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
<BR>crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but
<BR>directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me
<BR>farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out
<BR>my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so
<BR>clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for
<BR>your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I
<BR>have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
<BR>have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable
<BR>measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
<BR>leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
<BR>armour on my back, under the correction of bragging
<BR>be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
<BR>Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse
<BR>for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
<BR>sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,
<BR>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
<BR>eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;
<BR>only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,
<BR>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
<BR>fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth
<BR>sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love
<BR>of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy
<BR>cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
<BR>love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee
<BR>that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the
<BR>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
<BR>livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
<BR>uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee
<BR>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other
<BR>places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that
<BR>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do
<BR>always reason themselves out again. What! a
<BR>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A
<BR>good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
<BR>black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow
<BR>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax
<BR>hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the
<BR>moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it
<BR>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
<BR>course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
<BR>me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,
<BR>take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
<BR>speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of
<BR>France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love
<BR>the friend of France; for I love France so well that
<BR>I will not part with a village of it; I will have it
<BR>all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am
<BR>yours, then yours is France and you are mine.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>I cannot tell vat is dat.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am
<BR>sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
<BR>wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook
<BR>off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand
<BR>vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what
<BR>then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est
<BR>France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,
<BR>Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
<BR>more French: I shall never move thee in French,
<BR>unless it be to laugh at me.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il
<BR>est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my
<BR>tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs
<BR>be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou
<BR>understand thus much English, canst thou love me?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>I cannot tell.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask
<BR>them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,
<BR>when you come into your closet, you'll question this
<BR>gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
<BR>her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
<BR>your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
<BR>rather, gentle princess, because I love thee
<BR>cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a
<BR>saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get
<BR>thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs
<BR>prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,
<BR>between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a
<BR>boy, half French, half English, that shall go to
<BR>Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
<BR>shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair
<BR>flower-de-luce?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>I do not know dat


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do
<BR>but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your
<BR>French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety
<BR>take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer
<BR>you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher
<BR>et devin deesse?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
<BR>most sage demoiselle dat is en France.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in
<BR>true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I
<BR>dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to
<BR>flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor
<BR>and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew
<BR>my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
<BR>when he got me: therefore was I created with a
<BR>stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when
<BR>I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,
<BR>Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:
<BR>my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of
<BR>beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou
<BR>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
<BR>shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:
<BR>and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you
<BR>have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
<BR>thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;
<BR>take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am
<BR>thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
<BR>ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is
<BR>thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry
<BR>Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before
<BR>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,
<BR>thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.
<BR>Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is
<BR>music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of
<BR>all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken
<BR>English; wilt thou have me?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please
<BR>him, Kate.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Den it sall also content me.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je
<BR>ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
<BR>baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne
<BR>serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon
<BR>tres-puissant seigneur.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
<BR>leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Madam my interpreter, what says she?


<tr valign=top><td>ALICE
<td>Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
<BR>France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>To kiss.


<tr valign=top><td>ALICE
<td>Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
<BR>before they are married, would she say?


<tr valign=top><td>ALICE
<td>Oui, vraiment.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear
<BR>Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak
<BR>list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of
<BR>manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our
<BR>places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will
<BR>do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your
<BR>country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently
<BR>and yielding.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Kissing her]

<tr valign=top><td><td>You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
<BR>more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
<BR>tongues of the French council; and they should
<BR>sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
<BR>petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY,
<BR>and other Lords]


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you
<BR>our princess English?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
<BR>perfectly I love her; and that is good English.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>Is she not apt?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not
<BR>smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the
<BR>heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up
<BR>the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in
<BR>his true likeness.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you
<BR>for that. If you would conjure in her, you must
<BR>make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true
<BR>likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you
<BR>blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the
<BR>virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the
<BR>appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
<BR>self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid
<BR>to consign to.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>They are then excused, my lord, when they see not
<BR>what they do.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will
<BR>teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well
<BR>summered and warm kept, are like flies at
<BR>Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their
<BR>eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
<BR>before would not abide looking on.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;
<BR>and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
<BR>latter end and she must be blind too.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>As love is, my lord, before it loves.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for
<BR>my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city
<BR>for one fair French maid that stands in my way.


<tr valign=top><td>FRENCH KING
<td>Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities
<BR>turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with
<BR>maiden walls that war hath never entered.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Shall Kate be my wife?


<tr valign=top><td>FRENCH KING
<td>So please you.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may
<BR>wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for
<BR>my wish shall show me the way to my will.


<tr valign=top><td>FRENCH KING
<td>We have consented to all terms of reason.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>Is't so, my lords of England?


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>The king hath granted every article:
<BR>His daughter first, and then in sequel all,
<BR>According to their firm proposed natures.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
<BR>Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,
<BR>having any occasion to write for matter of grant,
<BR>shall name your highness in this form and with this
<BR>addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi
<BR>d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in
<BR>Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex
<BR>Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.


<tr valign=top><td>FRENCH KING
<td>Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
<BR>But your request shall make me let it pass.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
<BR>Let that one article rank with the rest;
<BR>And thereupon give me your daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>FRENCH KING
<td>Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
<BR>Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms
<BR>Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
<BR>With envy of each other's happiness,
<BR>May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
<BR>Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
<BR>In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance

<tr valign=top><td>ALL
<td>Amen!


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V

<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ISABEL
<td>God, the best maker of all marriages,
<BR>Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
<BR>As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
<BR>So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,
<BR>That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,
<BR>Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
<BR>Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,
<BR>To make divorce of their incorporate league;

<tr valign=top><td>Chorus

<BR>Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King
