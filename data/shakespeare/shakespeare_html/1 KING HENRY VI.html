<tr valign=top><td><td>[Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the
<BR>Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of
<BR>France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of
<BR>WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, &amp;c]


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
<BR>Comets, importing change of times and states,
<BR>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
<BR>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
<BR>That have consented unto Henry's death!
<BR>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
<BR>England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>England ne'er had a king until his time.
<BR>Virtue he had, deserving to command:
<BR>His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
<BR>His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
<BR>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
<BR>More dazzled and drove back his enemies
<BR>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
<BR>What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
<BR>He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
<BR>Henry is dead and never shall revive:
<BR>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
<BR>And death's dishonourable victory
<BR>We with our stately presence glorify,
<BR>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
<BR>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
<BR>That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
<BR>Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
<BR>Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him
<BR>By magic verses have contrived his end?


<tr valign=top><td>BISHOP
<BR>OF WINCHESTER
<td>
<BR>He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
<BR>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
<BR>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
<BR>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
<BR>The church's prayers made him so prosperous.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,
<BR>His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
<BR>None do you like but an effeminate prince,
<BR>Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.


<tr valign=top><td>BISHOP
<BR>OF WINCHESTER
<td>
<BR>Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector
<BR>And lookest to command the prince and realm.
<BR>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
<BR>More than God or religious churchmen may.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,
<BR>And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
<BR>Except it be to pray against thy foes.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
<BR>Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
<BR>Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:
<BR>Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
<BR>Posterity, await for wretched years,
<BR>When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
<BR>Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
<BR>And none but women left to wail the dead.
<BR>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:
<BR>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
<BR>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
<BR>A far more glorious star thy soul will make
<BR>Than Julius Caesar or bright--

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Messenger]


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>My honourable lords, health to you all!
<BR>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
<BR>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:
<BR>Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,
<BR>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
<BR>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
<BR>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
<BR>If Henry were recall'd to life again,
<BR>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>How were they lost? what treachery was used?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>No treachery; but want of men and money.
<BR>Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,
<BR>That here you maintain several factions,
<BR>And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
<BR>You are disputing of your generals:
<BR>One would have lingering wars with little cost;
<BR>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
<BR>A third thinks, without expense at all,
<BR>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
<BR>Awake, awake, English nobility!
<BR>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:
<BR>Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
<BR>Of England's coat one half is cut away.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
<BR>These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
<BR>Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
<BR>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
<BR>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
<BR>To weep their intermissive miseries.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter to them another Messenger]


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.
<BR>France is revolted from the English quite,
<BR>Except some petty towns of no import:
<BR>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;
<BR>The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
<BR>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
<BR>The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
<BR>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
<BR>Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
<BR>An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
<BR>Wherewith already France is overrun.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter another Messenger]


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
<BR>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
<BR>I must inform you of a dismal fight
<BR>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.


<tr valign=top><td>BISHOP
<BR>OF WINCHESTER
<td>
<BR>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:
<BR>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
<BR>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
<BR>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
<BR>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
<BR>By three and twenty thousand of the French
<BR>Was round encompassed and set upon.
<BR>No leisure had he to enrank his men;
<BR>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
<BR>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
<BR>They pitched in the ground confusedly,
<BR>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
<BR>More than three hours the fight continued;
<BR>Where valiant Talbot above human thought
<BR>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
<BR>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
<BR>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:
<BR>The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;
<BR>All the whole army stood agazed on him:
<BR>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
<BR>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
<BR>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
<BR>Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
<BR>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:
<BR>He, being in the vaward, placed behind
<BR>With purpose to relieve and follow them,
<BR>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
<BR>Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;
<BR>Enclosed were they with their enemies:
<BR>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
<BR>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
<BR>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
<BR>Durst not presume to look once in the face.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
<BR>For living idly here in pomp and ease,
<BR>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
<BR>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,
<BR>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:
<BR>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
<BR>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:
<BR>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
<BR>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
<BR>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
<BR>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
<BR>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
<BR>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
<BR>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;
<BR>The English army is grown weak and faint:
<BR>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
<BR>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
<BR>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
<BR>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
<BR>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.


<tr valign=top><td>BEDFORD
<td>I do remember it; and here take my leave,
<BR>To go about my preparation.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,
<BR>To view the artillery and munition;
<BR>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
<BR>Being ordain'd his special governor,
<BR>And for his safety there I'll best devise.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>BISHOP
<BR>OF WINCHESTER
<td>
<BR>Each hath his place and function to attend:
<BR>I am left out; for me nothing remains.
<BR>But long I will not be Jack out of office:
<BR>The king from Eltham I intend to steal
<BR>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.

<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES

<BR>So in the earth, to this day is not known:
<BR>Late did he shine upon the English side;
<BR>Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
<BR>What towns of any moment but we have?
<BR>At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
<BR>Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,

<tr valign=top><td>ALENCON

<BR>Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.


<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER

<BR>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:

<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER
<td>Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
<BR>He fighteth as one weary of his life.
<BR>The other lords, like lions wanting food,

<tr valign=top><td>ALENCON
<td>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
<BR>England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
<BR>During the time Edward the Third did reign.
<BR>More truly now may this be verified;
<BR>For none but Samsons and Goliases
<BR>It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
<BR>Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose
<BR>They had such courage and audacity?


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
<BR>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
<BR>Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
<BR>The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.


<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER
<td>I think, by some odd gimmors or device
<BR>Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;

<BR>A holy maid hither with me I bring,
<BR>Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
<BR>Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
<BR>And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
<BR>The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
<BR>Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
<BR>What's past and what's to come she can descry.

<BR>Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
<BR>To shine on my contemptible estate:
<BR>Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
<BR>And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
<BR>God's mother deigned to appear to me
<BR>And in a vision full of majesty
<BR>Will'd me to leave my base vocation
<BR>And free my country from calamity:
<BR>Her aid she promised and assured success:
<BR>In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
<BR>And, whereas I was black and swart before,
<BR>With those clear rays which she infused on me
<BR>That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
<BR>Ask me what question thou canst possible,
<BR>And I will answer unpremeditated:
<BR>My courage try by combat, if thou darest,
<BR>And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
<BR>Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
<BR>If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES

<BR>Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
<BR>My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
<BR>Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
<BR>Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
<BR>'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.


<tr valign=top><td>JOAN LA PUCELLE
<td>I must not yield to any rites of love,

<tr valign=top><td>JOAN LA PUCELLE

<BR>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
<BR>Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
<BR>The first-begotten and the lawful heir,
<BR>Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
<BR>During whose reign the Percies of the north,
<BR>Finding his usurpation most unjust,
<BR>Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
<BR>The reason moved these warlike lords to this
<BR>Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
<BR>Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
<BR>I was the next by birth and parentage;
<BR>For by my mother I derived am
<BR>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
<BR>To King Edward the Third; whereas he
<BR>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
<BR>Being but fourth of that heroic line.
<BR>But mark: as in this haughty attempt
<BR>They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
<BR>I lost my liberty and they their lives.
<BR>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
<BR>Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
<BR>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived
<BR>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
<BR>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,

<BR>Levied an army, weening to redeem

<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER

<BR>I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,

<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:
<BR>Consent, and for thy honour give consent,
<BR>Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;
<BR>Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
<BR>And this her easy-held imprisonment
<BR>Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.


<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER
<td>Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK

<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
<BR>Fit to be made companion with a king:
<BR>What answer makes your grace unto my suit?


<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER
<td>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
<BR>To be the princely bride of such a lord;
<BR>Upon condition I may quietly
<BR>Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,
<BR>Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
<BR>My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>That is her ransom; I deliver her;
<BR>And those two counties I will undertake
<BR>Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.


<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER
<td>And I again, in Henry's royal name,
<BR>As deputy unto that gracious king,
<BR>Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.

<BR>Because this is in traffic of a king.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And yet, methinks, I could be well content
<BR>To be mine own attorney in this case.
<BR>I'll over then to England with this news,
<BR>And make this marriage to be solemnized.
<BR>So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe
<BR>In golden palaces, as it becomes.


<tr valign=top><td>REIGNIER
<td>I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
<BR>The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.

<BR>Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Going]


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;
<BR>No princely commendations to my king?


<tr valign=top><td>MARGARET
<td>Such commendations as becomes a maid,
<BR>A virgin and his servant, say to him.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
<BR>But madam, I must trouble you again;
<BR>No loving token to his majesty?


<tr valign=top><td>MARGARET
<td>Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,
<BR>Never yet taint with love, I send the king.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>And this withal.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Kisses her]


<tr valign=top><td>MARGARET
<td>That for thyself: I will not so presume
<BR>To send such peevish tokens to a king.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET]

<td>O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;
<BR>Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;
<BR>There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
<BR>Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
<BR>Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
<BR>And natural graces that extinguish art;
<BR>Repeat their semblance often on the seas,

<BR>Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
<BR>But issued from the progeny of kings;
<BR>Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
<BR>By inspiration of celestial grace,
<BR>To work exceeding miracles on earth.
<BR>I never had to do with wicked spirits:

<BR>Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
<BR>Because you want the grace that others have,
<BR>You judge it straight a thing impossible
<BR>To compass wonders but by help of devils.
<BR>No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
<BR>A virgin from her tender infancy,
<BR>Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
<BR>Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
<BR>Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI,
<BR>GLOUCESTER and EXETER]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
<BR>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
<BR>Her virtues graced with external gifts
<BR>Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
<BR>And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
<BR>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
<BR>So am I driven by breath of her renown
<BR>Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
<BR>Where I may have fruition of her love.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
<BR>Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
<BR>The chief perfections of that lovely dame
<BR>Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
<BR>Would make a volume of enticing lines,
<BR>Able to ravish any dull conceit:
<BR>And, which is more, she is not so divine,
<BR>So full-replete with choice of all delights,
<BR>But with as humble lowliness of mind
<BR>She is content to be at your command;
<BR>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
<BR>To love and honour Henry as her lord.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
<BR>Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
<BR>That Margaret may be England's royal queen.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>So should I give consent to flatter sin.
<BR>You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
<BR>Unto another lady of esteem:
<BR>How shall we then dispense with that contract,
<BR>And not deface your honour with reproach?


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
<BR>Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
<BR>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
<BR>By reason of his adversary's odds:
<BR>A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
<BR>And therefore may be broke without offence.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
<BR>Her father is no better than an earl,
<BR>Although in glorious titles he excel.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>Yes, lord, her father is a king,
<BR>The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
<BR>And of such great authority in France
<BR>As his alliance will confirm our peace
<BR>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
<BR>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
<BR>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.


<tr valign=top><td>SUFFOLK
<td>A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
<BR>That he should be so abject, base and poor,
<BR>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
<BR>Henry is able to enrich his queen
<BR>And not seek a queen to make him rich:
<BR>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
<BR>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
<BR>Marriage is a matter of more worth
<BR>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;
<BR>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
<BR>Must be companion of his nuptial bed:
<BR>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
<BR>It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
<BR>In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
<BR>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
<BR>An age of discord and continual strife?
<BR>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
<BR>And is a pattern of celestial peace.
<BR>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
<BR>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
<BR>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
<BR>Approves her fit for none but for a king:
<BR>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
<BR>More than in women commonly is seen,
<BR>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
<BR>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
<BR>Is likely to beget more conquerors,
<BR>If with a lady of so high resolve
<BR>As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
<BR>Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
<BR>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Whether it be through force of your report,
<BR>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
<BR>My tender youth was never yet attaint
<BR>With any passion of inflaming love,
<BR>I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
<BR>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
<BR>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
<BR>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
<BR>Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
<BR>Agree to any covenants, and procure
<BR>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
<BR>To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
<BR>King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
<BR>For your expenses and sufficient charge,
<BR>Among the people gather up a tenth.
<BR>Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,
<BR>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
<BR>And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
<BR>If you do censure me by what you were,
<BR>Not what you are, I know it will excuse
<BR>This sudden execution of my will.
<BR>And so, conduct me where, from company,
<BR>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]
