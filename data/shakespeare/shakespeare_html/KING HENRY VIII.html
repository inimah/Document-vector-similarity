<tr valign=top><td><td>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,
<BR>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
<BR>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
<BR>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
<BR>We now present. Those that can pity, here
<BR>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
<BR>The subject will deserve it. Such as give
<BR>Their money out of hope they may believe,
<BR>May here find truth too. Those that come to see
<BR>Only a show or two, and so agree
<BR>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
<BR>I'll undertake may see away their shilling
<BR>Richly in two short hours. Only they
<BR>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
<BR>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
<BR>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
<BR>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,
<BR>To rank our chosen truth with such a show
<BR>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
<BR>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,
<BR>To make that only true we now intend,
<BR>Will leave us never an understanding friend.
<BR>Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known
<BR>The first and happiest hearers of the town,
<BR>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see
<BR>The very persons of our noble story
<BR>As they were living; think you see them great,
<BR>And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
<BR>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see
<BR>How soon this mightiness meets misery:
<BR>And, if you can be merry then, I'll say
<BR>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM
<BR>and ABERGAVENNY]


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
<BR>Since last we saw in France?


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>I thank your grace,
<BR>Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer
<BR>Of what I saw there.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>An untimely ague
<BR>Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
<BR>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
<BR>Met in the vale of Andren.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
<BR>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;
<BR>Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung
<BR>In their embracement, as they grew together;
<BR>Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd
<BR>Such a compounded one?


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>All the whole time
<BR>I was my chamber's prisoner.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Then you lost
<BR>The view of earthly glory: men might say,
<BR>Till this time pomp was single, but now married
<BR>To one above itself. Each following day
<BR>Became the next day's master, till the last
<BR>Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
<BR>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
<BR>Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they
<BR>Made Britain India: every man that stood
<BR>Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
<BR>As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,
<BR>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
<BR>The pride upon them, that their very labour
<BR>Was to them as a painting: now this masque
<BR>Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
<BR>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
<BR>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
<BR>As presence did present them; him in eye,
<BR>Still him in praise: and, being present both
<BR>'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner
<BR>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
<BR>For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
<BR>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
<BR>Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,
<BR>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
<BR>That Bevis was believed.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>O, you go far.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>As I belong to worship and affect
<BR>In honour honesty, the tract of every thing
<BR>Would by a good discourser lose some life,
<BR>Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;
<BR>To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.
<BR>Order gave each thing view; the office did
<BR>Distinctly his full function.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Who did guide,
<BR>I mean, who set the body and the limbs
<BR>Of this great sport together, as you guess?


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>One, certes, that promises no element
<BR>In such a business.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>I pray you, who, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>All this was order'd by the good discretion
<BR>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
<BR>From his ambitious finger. What had he
<BR>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
<BR>That such a keech can with his very bulk
<BR>Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
<BR>And keep it from the earth.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Surely, sir,
<BR>There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
<BR>For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
<BR>Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
<BR>For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
<BR>For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,
<BR>Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,
<BR>The force of his own merit makes his way
<BR>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
<BR>A place next to the king.


<tr valign=top><td>ABERGAVENNY
<td>I cannot tell
<BR>What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye
<BR>Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
<BR>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
<BR>If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,
<BR>Or has given all before, and he begins
<BR>A new hell in himself.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Why the devil,
<BR>Upon this French going out, took he upon him,
<BR>Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
<BR>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
<BR>Of all the gentry; for the most part such
<BR>To whom as great a charge as little honour
<BR>He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,
<BR>The honourable board of council out,
<BR>Must fetch him in the papers.


<tr valign=top><td>ABERGAVENNY
<td>I do know
<BR>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
<BR>By this so sickened their estates, that never
<BR>They shall abound as formerly.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>O, many
<BR>Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
<BR>For this great journey. What did this vanity
<BR>But minister communication of
<BR>A most poor issue?


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Grievingly I think,
<BR>The peace between the French and us not values
<BR>The cost that did conclude it.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Every man,
<BR>After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
<BR>A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke
<BR>Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,
<BR>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
<BR>The sudden breach on't.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Which is budded out;
<BR>For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd
<BR>Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.


<tr valign=top><td>ABERGAVENNY
<td>Is it therefore
<BR>The ambassador is silenced?


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Marry, is't.


<tr valign=top><td>ABERGAVENNY
<td>A proper title of a peace; and purchased
<BR>At a superfluous rate!


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Why, all this business
<BR>Our reverend cardinal carried.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Like it your grace,
<BR>The state takes notice of the private difference
<BR>Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
<BR>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
<BR>Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
<BR>The cardinal's malice and his potency
<BR>Together; to consider further that
<BR>What his high hatred would effect wants not
<BR>A minister in his power. You know his nature,
<BR>That he's revengeful, and I know his sword
<BR>Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,
<BR>It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
<BR>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
<BR>You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
<BR>That I advise your shunning.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,
<BR>certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with
<BR>papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his
<BR>eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full
<BR>of disdain]


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL WOLSEY
<td>The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
<BR>Where's his examination?


<tr valign=top><td>First Secretary
<td>Here, so please you.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL WOLSEY
<td>Is he in person ready?


<tr valign=top><td>First Secretary
<td>Ay, please your grace.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL WOLSEY
<td>Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham
<BR>Shall lessen this big look.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train]


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I
<BR>Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
<BR>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
<BR>Outworths a noble's blood.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>What, are you chafed?
<BR>Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
<BR>Which your disease requires.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>I read in's looks
<BR>Matter against me; and his eye reviled
<BR>Me, as his abject object: at this instant
<BR>He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
<BR>I'll follow and outstare him.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Stay, my lord,
<BR>And let your reason with your choler question
<BR>What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
<BR>Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
<BR>A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
<BR>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
<BR>Can advise me like you: be to yourself
<BR>As you would to your friend.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>I'll to the king;
<BR>And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
<BR>This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
<BR>There's difference in no persons.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Be advised;
<BR>Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
<BR>That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,
<BR>By violent swiftness, that which we run at,
<BR>And lose by over-running. Know you not,
<BR>The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,
<BR>In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:
<BR>I say again, there is no English soul
<BR>More stronger to direct you than yourself,
<BR>If with the sap of reason you would quench,
<BR>Or but allay, the fire of passion.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Sir,
<BR>I am thankful to you; and I'll go along
<BR>By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,
<BR>Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
<BR>From sincere motions, by intelligence,
<BR>And proofs as clear as founts in July when
<BR>We see each grain of gravel, I do know
<BR>To be corrupt and treasonous.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Say not 'treasonous.'


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
<BR>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
<BR>Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous
<BR>As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
<BR>As able to perform't; his mind and place
<BR>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--
<BR>Only to show his pomp as well in France
<BR>As here at home, suggests the king our master
<BR>To this last costly treaty, the interview,
<BR>That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
<BR>Did break i' the rinsing.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Faith, and so it did.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal
<BR>The articles o' the combination drew
<BR>As himself pleased; and they were ratified
<BR>As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
<BR>As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
<BR>Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
<BR>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--
<BR>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
<BR>To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,
<BR>Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
<BR>For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
<BR>To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:
<BR>His fears were, that the interview betwixt
<BR>England and France might, through their amity,
<BR>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
<BR>Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
<BR>Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--
<BR>Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
<BR>Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
<BR>Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
<BR>And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,
<BR>That he would please to alter the king's course,
<BR>And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,
<BR>As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
<BR>Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
<BR>And for his own advantage.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>I am sorry
<BR>To hear this of him; and could wish he were
<BR>Something mistaken in't.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>No, not a syllable:
<BR>I  do pronounce him in that very shape
<BR>He shall appear in proof.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and
<BR>two or three of the Guard]


<tr valign=top><td>BRANDON
<td>Your office, sergeant; execute it.


<tr valign=top><td>Sergeant
<td>Sir,
<BR>My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
<BR>Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
<BR>Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
<BR>Of our most sovereign king.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Lo, you, my lord,
<BR>The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
<BR>Under device and practise.


<tr valign=top><td>BRANDON
<td>I am sorry
<BR>To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
<BR>The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
<BR>You shall to the Tower.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>It will help me nothing
<BR>To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
<BR>Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven
<BR>Be done in this and all things! I obey.
<BR>O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!


<tr valign=top><td>BRANDON

<tr valign=top><td><td>Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know

<tr valign=top><td>ABERGAVENNY

<BR>By me obey'd!


<tr valign=top><td>BRANDON
<td>Here is a warrant from
<BR>The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
<BR>Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
<BR>One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--

<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN KATHARINE
<td>I am solicited, not by a few,
<BR>And those of true condition, that your subjects
<BR>Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
<BR>Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
<BR>Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,

<BR>Most bitterly on you, as putter on
<BR>Of these exactions, yet the king our master--
<BR>Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he
<BR>escapes not
<BR>Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks

<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK

<tr valign=top><td>Surveyor
<td>Not long before your highness sped to France,
<BR>The duke being at the Rose, within the parish

<BR>What was the speech among the Londoners
<BR>Concerning the French journey: I replied,
<BR>Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,
<BR>To the king's danger. Presently the duke
<BR>Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted
<BR>'Twould prove the verity of certain words
<BR>Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,
<BR>'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
<BR>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
<BR>To hear from him a matter of some moment:
<BR>Whom after under the confession's seal
<BR>He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
<BR>My chaplain to no creature living, but
<BR>To me, should utter, with demure confidence
<BR>This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,
<BR>Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
<BR>To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
<BR>Shall govern England.'


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN KATHARINE
<td>If I know you well,
<BR>You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office
<BR>On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
<BR>You charge not in your spleen a noble person
<BR>And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
<BR>Yes, heartily beseech you.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>Let him on.
<BR>Go forward.


<tr valign=top><td>Surveyor
<td>On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
<BR>I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions
<BR>The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him
<BR>To ruminate on this so far, until
<BR>It forged him some design, which, being believed,
<BR>It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,
<BR>It can do me no damage;' adding further,
<BR>That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,
<BR>The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
<BR>Should have gone off.

<BR>As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd
<BR>The part my father meant to act upon

<BR>Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,

<BR>The cardinal is the end of this.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman

<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Let's stand close, and behold him.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>All good people,
<BR>You that thus far have come to pity me,
<BR>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
<BR>I have this day received a traitor's judgment,
<BR>And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
<BR>And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,
<BR>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
<BR>The law I bear no malice for my death;
<BR>'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:
<BR>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
<BR>Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:
<BR>Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
<BR>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
<BR>For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
<BR>For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
<BR>Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
<BR>More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,
<BR>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
<BR>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
<BR>Is only bitter to him, only dying,
<BR>Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
<BR>And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
<BR>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
<BR>And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.


<tr valign=top><td>LOVELL
<td>I do beseech your grace, for charity,
<BR>If ever any malice in your heart
<BR>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
<BR>As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
<BR>There cannot be those numberless offences
<BR>'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:
<BR>no black envy
<BR>Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;
<BR>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him
<BR>You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
<BR>Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
<BR>Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
<BR>Longer than I have time to tell his years!
<BR>Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
<BR>And when old time shall lead him to his end,
<BR>Goodness and he fill up one monument!


<tr valign=top><td>LOVELL
<td>To the water side I must conduct your grace;
<BR>Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
<BR>Who undertakes you to your end.


<tr valign=top><td>VAUX
<td>Prepare there,
<BR>The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;
<BR>And fit it with such furniture as suits
<BR>The greatness of his person.


<tr valign=top><td>BUCKINGHAM
<td>Nay, Sir Nicholas,
<BR>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
<BR>When I came hither, I was lord high constable
<BR>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:
<BR>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
<BR>That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
<BR>And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.
<BR>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
<BR>Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
<BR>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
<BR>Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,
<BR>And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
<BR>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
<BR>My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
<BR>Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
<BR>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
<BR>Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
<BR>That made me happy at one stroke has taken
<BR>For ever from the world. I had my trial,
<BR>And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,
<BR>A little happier than my wretched father:
<BR>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
<BR>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;
<BR>A most unnatural and faithless service!
<BR>Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
<BR>This from a dying man receive as certain:
<BR>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
<BR>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
<BR>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
<BR>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
<BR>Like water from ye, never found again
<BR>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
<BR>Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour
<BR>Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:
<BR>And when you would say something that is sad,
<BR>Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman

<BR>I do not talk much.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I am confident,
<BR>You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear
<BR>A buzzing of a separation
<BR>Between the king and Katharine?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Yes, but it held not:
<BR>For when the king once heard it, out of anger
<BR>He sent command to the lord mayor straight
<BR>To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues
<BR>That durst disperse it.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>But that slander, sir,
<BR>Is found a truth now: for it grows again
<BR>Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
<BR>The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
<BR>Or some about him near, have, out of malice
<BR>To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple
<BR>That will undo her: to confirm this too,
<BR>Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;
<BR>As all think, for this business.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>'Tis the cardinal;
<BR>And merely to revenge him on the emperor
<BR>For not bestowing on him, at his asking,
<BR>The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel
<BR>That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
<BR>Will have his will, and she must fall.

<BR>Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
<BR>Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:
<BR>And out of all these to restore the king,
<BR>He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
<BR>That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
<BR>About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;
<BR>Of her that loves him with that excellence

<BR>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
<BR>Have I not strove to love, although I knew
<BR>He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
<BR>That had to him derived your anger, did I
<BR>Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice
<BR>He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind
<BR>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,
<BR>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
<BR>With many children by you: if, in the course
<BR>And process of this time, you can report,
<BR>And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
<BR>My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,
<BR>Against your sacred person, in God's name,
<BR>Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt
<BR>Shut door upon me, and so give me up
<BR>To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,
<BR>The king, your father, was reputed for
<BR>A prince most prudent, of an excellent
<BR>And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,
<BR>My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one
<BR>The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
<BR>A year before: it is not to be question'd

<BR>That it shall please you to declare, in hearing

<BR>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
<BR>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
<BR>Be to the prejudice of her present state,
<BR>Or touch of her good person?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>My lord cardinal,
<BR>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
<BR>I free you from't. You are not to be taught
<BR>That you have many enemies, that know not
<BR>Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,
<BR>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
<BR>The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
<BR>But will you be more justified? You ever
<BR>Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired
<BR>It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
<BR>The passages made toward it: on my honour,
<BR>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,
<BR>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,
<BR>I will be bold with time and your attention:
<BR>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
<BR>My conscience first received a tenderness,
<BR>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
<BR>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;
<BR>Who had been hither sent on the debating
<BR>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
<BR>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,
<BR>Ere a determinate resolution, he,
<BR>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;
<BR>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
<BR>Whether our daughter were legitimate,
<BR>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
<BR>Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook
<BR>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
<BR>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
<BR>The region of my breast; which forced such way,
<BR>That many mazed considerings did throng
<BR>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
<BR>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
<BR>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
<BR>If it conceived a male child by me, should
<BR>Do no more offices of life to't than
<BR>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
<BR>Or died where they were made, or shortly after
<BR>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
<BR>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
<BR>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
<BR>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that
<BR>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
<BR>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
<BR>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
<BR>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
<BR>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
<BR>Now present here together: that's to say,
<BR>I meant to rectify my conscience,--which
<BR>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--
<BR>By all the reverend fathers of the land
<BR>And doctors learn'd: first I began in private
<BR>With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
<BR>How under my oppression I did reek,
<BR>When I first moved you.


<tr valign=top><td>LINCOLN
<td>Very well, my liege.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
<BR>How far you satisfied me.


<tr valign=top><td>LINCOLN
<td>So please your highness,
<BR>The question did at first so stagger me,
<BR>Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
<BR>And consequence of dread, that I committed
<BR>The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;
<BR>And did entreat your highness to this course
<BR>Which you are running here.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>I then moved you,
<BR>My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave
<BR>To make this present summons: unsolicited
<BR>I left no reverend person in this court;
<BR>But by particular consent proceeded
<BR>Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
<BR>For no dislike i' the world against the person
<BR>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
<BR>Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:
<BR>Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
<BR>And kingly dignity, we are contented
<BR>To wear our mortal state to come with her,
<BR>Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
<BR>That's paragon'd o' the world.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
<td>So please your highness,
<BR>The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness

<BR>To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
<BR>That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
<BR>What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
<BR>Some little memory of me will stir him--
<BR>I know his noble nature--not to let
<BR>Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
<BR>Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
<BR>For thine own future safety.


<tr valign=top><td>CROMWELL

<BR>Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego
<BR>So good, so noble and so true a master?
<BR>Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
<BR>With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
<BR>The king shall have my service: but my prayers
<BR>For ever and for ever shall be yours.


<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL WOLSEY
<td>Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
<BR>In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
<BR>Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
<BR>Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
<BR>And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
<BR>And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
<BR>Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
<BR>Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
<BR>And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
<BR>Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
<BR>A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
<BR>Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
<BR>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
<BR>By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
<BR>The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
<BR>Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
<BR>Corruption wins not more than honesty.
<BR>Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
<BR>To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
<BR>Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
<BR>Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,
<BR>O Cromwell,
<BR>Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
<BR>And,--prithee, lead me in:
<BR>There take an inventory of all I have,
<BR>To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
<BR>And my integrity to heaven, is all
<BR>I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
<BR>Had I but served my God with half the zeal
<BR>I served my king, he would not in mine age
<BR>Have left me naked to mine enemies.

<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>You're well met once again.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>So are you.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>You come to take your stand here, and behold
<BR>The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
<BR>The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
<BR>This, general joy.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>'Tis well: the citizens,
<BR>I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--
<BR>As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--
<BR>In celebration of this day with shows,
<BR>Pageants and sights of honour.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Never greater,
<BR>Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>May I be bold to ask at what that contains,
<BR>That paper in your hand?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Yes; 'tis the list
<BR>Of those that claim their offices this day
<BR>By custom of the coronation.
<BR>The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
<BR>To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
<BR>He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,
<BR>I should have been beholding to your paper.
<BR>But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
<BR>The princess dowager? how goes her business?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
<BR>Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
<BR>Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
<BR>Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off
<BR>From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which
<BR>She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:
<BR>And, to be short, for not appearance and
<BR>The king's late scruple, by the main assent
<BR>Of all these learned men she was divorced,
<BR>And the late marriage made of none effect
<BR>Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,
<BR>Where she remains now sick.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman

<tr valign=top><td><td>The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.

<tr valign=top><td><td>1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.

<tr valign=top><td><td>2. Then, two Judges.

<tr valign=top><td><td>3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace
<BR>before him.

<tr valign=top><td><td>4. Choristers, singing.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Music]

<tr valign=top><td><td>5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then
<BR>Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
<BR>head a gilt copper crown.

<tr valign=top><td><td>6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,
<BR>on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With
<BR>him, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with
<BR>the dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.
<BR>Collars of SS.

<tr valign=top><td><td>7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet
<BR>on his head, bearing a long white wand, as
<BR>high-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with the
<BR>rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.
<BR>Collars of SS.

<tr valign=top><td><td>8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;
<BR>under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair
<BR>richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each
<BR>side her, the Bishops of London and
<BR>Winchester.

<tr valign=top><td><td>9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of
<BR>gold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEEN
<BR>ANNE's train.

<tr valign=top><td><td>10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain
<BR>circlets of gold without flowers.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They pass over the stage in order and state]


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>A royal train, believe me. These I know:
<BR>Who's that that bears the sceptre?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Marquess Dorset:
<BR>And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>A bold brave gentleman. That should be
<BR>The Duke of Suffolk?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>'Tis the same: high-steward.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>And that my Lord of Norfolk?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Yes;


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Heaven bless thee!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Looking on QUEEN ANNE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
<BR>Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
<BR>Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
<BR>And more and richer, when he strains that lady:
<BR>I cannot blame his conscience.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>They that bear
<BR>The cloth of honour over her, are four barons
<BR>Of the Cinque-ports.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
<BR>I take it, she that carries up the train
<BR>Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>It is; and all the rest are countesses.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;
<BR>And sometimes falling ones.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>No more of that.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a third Gentleman]


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger
<BR>Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled
<BR>With the mere rankness of their joy.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>You saw
<BR>The ceremony?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>That I did.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>How was it?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Well worth the seeing.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Good sir, speak it to us.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>As well as I am able. The rich stream
<BR>Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
<BR>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off
<BR>A distance from her; while her grace sat down
<BR>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
<BR>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
<BR>The beauty of her person to the people.
<BR>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
<BR>That ever lay by man: which when the people
<BR>Had the full view of, such a noise arose
<BR>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
<BR>As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
<BR>Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces
<BR>Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
<BR>I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
<BR>That had not half a week to go, like rams
<BR>In the old time of war, would shake the press,
<BR>And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
<BR>Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven
<BR>So strangely in one piece.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>But, what follow'd?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>At length her grace rose, and with modest paces
<BR>Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like
<BR>Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.
<BR>Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
<BR>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
<BR>She had all the royal makings of a queen;
<BR>As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,
<BR>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
<BR>Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,
<BR>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
<BR>Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,
<BR>And with the same full state paced back again
<BR>To York-place, where the feast is held.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Sir,
<BR>You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
<BR>For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:
<BR>'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>I know it;
<BR>But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name
<BR>Is fresh about me.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>What two reverend bishops
<BR>Were those that went on each side of the queen?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,
<BR>Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,
<BR>The other, London.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>He of Winchester
<BR>Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,
<BR>The virtuous Cranmer.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>All the land knows that:
<BR>However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,
<BR>Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Who may that be, I pray you?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Thomas Cromwell;
<BR>A man in much esteem with the king, and truly
<BR>A worthy friend. The king has made him master
<BR>O' the jewel house,
<BR>And one, already, of the privy council.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>He will deserve more.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Yes, without all doubt.
<BR>Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
<BR>Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:
<BR>Something I can command. As I walk thither,
<BR>I'll tell ye more.


<tr valign=top><td>Both

<BR>GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman]


<tr valign=top><td>GRIFFITH
<td>How does your grace?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>O Griffith, sick to death!
<BR>My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
<BR>Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:
<BR>So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
<BR>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
<BR>That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?


<tr valign=top><td>GRIFFITH
<td>Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
<BR>Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
<BR>If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
<BR>For my example.


<tr valign=top><td>GRIFFITH
<td>Well, the voice goes, madam:
<BR>For after the stout Earl Northumberland
<BR>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
<BR>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
<BR>He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
<BR>He could not sit his mule.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>Alas, poor man!


<tr valign=top><td>GRIFFITH
<td>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
<BR>Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
<BR>With all his covent, honourably received him;
<BR>To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,
<BR>An old man, broken with the storms of state,
<BR>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
<BR>Give him a little earth for charity!'
<BR>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
<BR>Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
<BR>About the hour of eight, which he himself
<BR>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
<BR>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
<BR>He gave his honours to the world again,
<BR>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE
<td>So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
<BR>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
<BR>And yet with charity. He was a man
<BR>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
<BR>Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,
<BR>Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
<BR>His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
<BR>He would say untruths; and be ever double
<BR>Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
<BR>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
<BR>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
<BR>But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
<BR>Of his own body he was ill, and gave
<BR>The clergy in example.


<tr valign=top><td>GRIFFITH

<BR>Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
<BR>We write in water. May it please your highness
<BR>To hear me speak his good now?

<td>Yes, good Griffith;
<BR>I were malicious else.


<tr valign=top><td>GRIFFITH
<td>This cardinal,
<BR>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
<BR>Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.
<BR>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
<BR>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:
<BR>Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
<BR>But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
<BR>And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
<BR>Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
<BR>He was most princely: ever witness for him
<BR>Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,
<BR>Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,
<BR>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
<BR>The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,
<BR>So excellent in art, and still so rising,
<BR>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
<BR>His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
<BR>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
<BR>And found the blessedness of being little:
<BR>And, to add greater honours to his age
<BR>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINE

<tr valign=top><td>Chancellor
<td>My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry
<BR>To sit here at this present, and behold
<BR>That chair stand empty: but we all are men,
<BR>In our own natures frail, and capable
<BR>Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty
<BR>And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
<BR>Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
<BR>Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling
<BR>The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,
<BR>For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,
<BR>Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
<BR>And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.


<tr valign=top><td>GARDINER
<td>Which reformation must be sudden too,
<BR>My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
<BR>Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
<BR>But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,
<BR>Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,
<BR>Out of our easiness and childish pity
<BR>To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,
<BR>Farewell all physic: and what follows then?
<BR>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint
<BR>Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,
<BR>The upper Germany, can dearly witness,
<BR>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.


<tr valign=top><td>CRANMER
<td>My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
<BR>Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
<BR>And with no little study, that my teaching
<BR>And the strong course of my authority
<BR>Might go one way, and safely; and the end
<BR>Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
<BR>I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
<BR>A man that more detests, more stirs against,
<BR>Both in his private conscience and his place,
<BR>Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
<BR>Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
<BR>With less allegiance in it! Men that make
<BR>Envy and crooked malice nourishment
<BR>Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
<BR>That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
<BR>Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
<BR>And freely urge against me.

<BR>You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
<BR>I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
<BR>You are so merciful: I see your end;
<BR>'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,

<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is
<BR>this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree
<BR>staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to
<BR>'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing
<BR>christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,
<BR>you rude rascals?


<tr valign=top><td>Man
<td>Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--
<BR>Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--
<BR>To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep
<BR>On May-day morning; which will never be:
<BR>We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>How got they in, and be hang'd?


<tr valign=top><td>Man
<td>Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?
<BR>As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
<BR>You see the poor remainder--could distribute,
<BR>I made no spare, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>You did nothing, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>Man
<td>I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,
<BR>To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any
<BR>That had a head to hit, either young or old,
<BR>He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,
<BR>Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again
<BR>And that I would not for a cow, God save her!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Within]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Do you hear, master porter?


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.
<BR>Keep the door close, sirrah.


<tr valign=top><td>Man
<td>What would you have me do?


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>What should you do, but knock 'em down by the
<BR>dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have
<BR>we some strange Indian with the great tool come to
<BR>court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a
<BR>fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian
<BR>conscience, this one christening will beget a
<BR>thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.


<tr valign=top><td>Man
<td>The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a
<BR>fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a
<BR>brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty
<BR>of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand
<BR>about him are under the line, they need no other
<BR>penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on
<BR>the head, and three times was his nose discharged
<BR>against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to
<BR>blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small
<BR>wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked
<BR>porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a
<BR>combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,
<BR>and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I
<BR>might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
<BR>her succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where
<BR>she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my
<BR>place: at length they came to the broom-staff to
<BR>me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of
<BR>boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower
<BR>of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,
<BR>and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst
<BR>'em, I think, surely.


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,
<BR>and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but
<BR>the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of
<BR>Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.
<BR>I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they
<BR>are like to dance these three days; besides the
<BR>running banquet of two beadles that is to come.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Chamberlain]


<tr valign=top><td>Chamberlain
<td>Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
<BR>They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,
<BR>As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
<BR>These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:
<BR>There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
<BR>Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
<BR>Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
<BR>When they pass back from the christening.


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>An't please
<BR>your honour,
<BR>We are but men; and what so many may do,
<BR>Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:
<BR>An army cannot rule 'em.


<tr valign=top><td>Chamberlain
<td>As I live,
<BR>If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
<BR>By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
<BR>Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;
<BR>And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
<BR>Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
<BR>They're come already from the christening:
<BR>Go, break among the press, and find a way out
<BR>To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
<BR>A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>Make way there for the princess.


<tr valign=top><td>Man
<td>You great fellow,
<BR>Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.


<tr valign=top><td>Porter
<td>You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;
<BR>I'll peck you o'er the pales else.

<tr valign=top><td>Garter

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard]

<BR>My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
<BR>All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII

<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII

<tr valign=top><td><td>[KING HENRY VIII kisses the child]

<tr valign=top><td><td>With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
<BR>Into whose hand I give thy life.


<tr valign=top><td>CRANMER
<td>Amen.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:
<BR>I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,
<BR>When she has so much English.


<tr valign=top><td>CRANMER
<td>Let me speak, sir,
<BR>For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
<BR>Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
<BR>This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
<BR>Though in her cradle, yet now promises
<BR>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
<BR>Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--
<BR>But few now living can behold that goodness--
<BR>A pattern to all princes living with her,
<BR>And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
<BR>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
<BR>Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
<BR>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
<BR>With all the virtues that attend the good,
<BR>Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
<BR>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
<BR>She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
<BR>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
<BR>And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
<BR>In her days every man shall eat in safety,
<BR>Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
<BR>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:
<BR>God shall be truly known; and those about her
<BR>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
<BR>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
<BR>Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
<BR>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
<BR>Her ashes new create another heir,
<BR>As great in admiration as herself;
<BR>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
<BR>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
<BR>Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
<BR>Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
<BR>And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
<BR>That were the servants to this chosen infant,
<BR>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
<BR>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
<BR>His honour and the greatness of his name
<BR>Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,
<BR>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
<BR>To all the plains about him: our children's children
<BR>Shall see this, and bless heaven.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>Thou speakest wonders.


<tr valign=top><td>CRANMER
<td>She shall be, to the happiness of England,
<BR>An aged princess; many days shall see her,
<BR>And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
<BR>Would I had known no more! but she must die,
<BR>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
<BR>A most unspotted lily shall she pass
<BR>To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VIII
<td>O lord archbishop,
<BR>Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
<BR>This happy child, did I get any thing:
<BR>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
<BR>That when I am in heaven I shall desire
<BR>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
<BR>I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
<BR>And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
<BR>I have received much honour by your presence,
<BR>And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
<BR>Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,
<BR>She will be sick else. This day, no man think
<BR>Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
<BR>This little one shall make it holiday.

<tr valign=top><td><td>EPILOGUE


<tr valign=top><td><td>'Tis ten to one this play can never please
<BR>All that are here: some come to take their ease,
<BR>And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
<BR>We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,
<BR>They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city
<BR>Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'
<BR>Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,
<BR>All the expected good we're like to hear
<BR>For this play at this time, is only in
<BR>The merciful construction of good women;
<BR>For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
<BR>And say 'twill do, I know, within a while
<BR>All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,
<BR>If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
