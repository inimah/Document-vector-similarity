<BR>The newest state.


<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>This is the sergeant
<BR>Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
<BR>'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
<BR>Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
<BR>As thou didst leave it.


<tr valign=top><td>Sergeant
<td>Doubtful it stood;
<BR>As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
<BR>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
<BR>Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
<BR>The multiplying villanies of nature
<BR>Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
<BR>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
<BR>And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
<BR>Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
<BR>For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
<BR>Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
<BR>Which smoked with bloody execution,
<BR>Like valour's minion carved out his passage
<BR>Till he faced the slave;
<BR>Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
<BR>Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
<BR>And fix'd his head upon our battlements.


<tr valign=top><td>DUNCAN
<td>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!


<tr valign=top><td>Sergeant
<td>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
<BR>Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
<BR>So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
<BR>Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:

<BR>Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
<BR>But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
<BR>With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
<BR>Began a fresh assault.


<tr valign=top><td>DUNCAN
<td>Dismay'd not this
<BR>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?


<tr valign=top><td>Sergeant
<td>Yes;
<BR>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
<BR>If I say sooth, I must report they were
<BR>As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
<BR>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
<BR>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
<BR>Or memorise another Golgotha,
<BR>I cannot tell.
<BR>But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.


<tr valign=top><td>DUNCAN
<td>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
<BR>They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.

<BR>That seems to speak things strange.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSS
<td>God save the king!


<tr valign=top><td>DUNCAN
<td>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSS
<td>From Fife, great king;
<BR>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
<BR>And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
<BR>With terrible numbers,
<BR>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
<BR>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
<BR>Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
<BR>Confronted him with self-comparisons,
<BR>Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
<BR>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
<BR>The victory fell on us.


<tr valign=top><td>DUNCAN
<td>Great happiness!


<tr valign=top><td>ROSS
<td>That now
<BR>Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
<BR>Nor would we deign him burial of his men
<BR>Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
<BR>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.


<tr valign=top><td>DUNCAN
<td>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive

<td>How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
<BR>So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
<BR>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
<BR>And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
<BR>That man may question? You seem to understand me,
<BR>By each at once her chappy finger laying
<BR>Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
<BR>And yet your beards forbid me to interpret

<BR>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
<BR>Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
<BR>You greet with present grace and great prediction
<BR>Of noble having and of royal hope,
<BR>That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
<BR>If you can look into the seeds of time,
<BR>And say which grain will grow and which will not,
<BR>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear

<BR>By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
<BR>But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
<BR>A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
<BR>Stands not within the prospect of belief,
<BR>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence

<tr valign=top><td>BANQUO
<td>To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ROSS and ANGUS]


<tr valign=top><td>ROSS
<td>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
<BR>The news of thy success; and when he reads
<BR>Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
<BR>His wonders and his praises do contend
<BR>Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
<BR>In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
<BR>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
<BR>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
<BR>Strange images of death. As thick as hail
<BR>Came post with post; and every one did bear
<BR>Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
<BR>And pour'd them down before him.


<tr valign=top><td>ANGUS
<td>We are sent
<BR>To give thee from our royal master thanks;
<BR>Only to herald thee into his sight,
<BR>Not pay thee.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSS
<td>And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
<BR>He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
<BR>In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
<BR>For it is thine.


<tr valign=top><td>BANQUO
<td>What, can the devil speak true?


<tr valign=top><td>MACBETH
<td>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
<BR>In borrow'd robes?


<tr valign=top><td>ANGUS
<td>Who was the thane lives yet;
<BR>But under heavy judgment bears that life
<BR>Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
<BR>With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
<BR>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
<BR>He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
<BR>But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
<BR>Have overthrown him.


<tr valign=top><td>MACBETH
<td>[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
<BR>The greatest is behind.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To ROSS and ANGUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Thanks for your pains.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To BANQUO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
<BR>When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
<BR>Promised no less to them?


<tr valign=top><td>BANQUO
<td>That trusted home
<BR>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
<BR>Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
<BR>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
<BR>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
<BR>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
<BR>In deepest consequence.
<BR>Cousins, a word, I pray you.


<tr valign=top><td>MACBETH

<BR>As happy prologues to the swelling act
<BR>Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside]  This supernatural soliciting
<BR>Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
<BR>Why hath it given me earnest of success,
<BR>Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
<BR>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
<BR>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
<BR>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
<BR>Against the use of nature? Present fears
<BR>Are less than horrible imaginings:
<BR>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
<BR>Shakes so my single state of man that function
<BR>Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
<BR>But what is not.


<tr valign=top><td>BANQUO

<tr valign=top><td>MACBETH

<tr valign=top><td>BANQUO

<tr valign=top><td>MACBETH

<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF

<BR>Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
<BR>Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
<BR>New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
<BR>Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
<BR>As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
<BR>Like syllable of dolour.


<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>What I believe I'll wail,
<BR>What know believe, and what I can redress,
<BR>As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
<BR>What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
<BR>This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
<BR>Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
<BR>He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
<BR>but something
<BR>You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
<BR>To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
<BR>To appease an angry god.


<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF
<td>I am not treacherous.


<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>But Macbeth is.
<BR>A good and virtuous nature may recoil
<BR>In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
<BR>your pardon;
<BR>That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
<BR>Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
<BR>Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
<BR>Yet grace must still look so.


<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF
<td>I have lost my hopes.

<BR>Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
<BR>Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
<BR>Without leave-taking? I pray you,
<BR>Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
<BR>But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,

<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF
<td>Bleed, bleed, poor country!
<BR>Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
<BR>For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
<BR>thy wrongs;
<BR>The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
<BR>I would not be the villain that thou think'st
<BR>For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
<BR>And the rich East to boot.


<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>Be not offended:
<BR>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
<BR>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
<BR>It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
<BR>Is added to her wounds: I think withal
<BR>There would be hands uplifted in my right;
<BR>And here from gracious England have I offer
<BR>Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
<BR>When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
<BR>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
<BR>Shall have more vices than it had before,
<BR>More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,

<BR>Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
<BR>With my confineless harms.


<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF
<td>Not in the legions
<BR>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd

<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>I grant him bloody,
<BR>Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
<BR>Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
<BR>That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
<BR>In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
<BR>Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
<BR>The cistern of my lust, and my desire
<BR>All continent impediments would o'erbear
<BR>That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
<BR>Than such an one to reign.


<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF
<td>Boundless intemperance
<BR>In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
<BR>The untimely emptying of the happy throne
<BR>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
<BR>To take upon you what is yours: you may
<BR>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
<BR>And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
<BR>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
<BR>That vulture in you, to devour so many
<BR>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
<BR>Finding it so inclined.


<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>With this there grows
<BR>In my most ill-composed affection such
<BR>A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
<BR>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
<BR>Desire his jewels and this other's house:
<BR>And my more-having would be as a sauce
<BR>To make me hunger more; that I should forge
<BR>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
<BR>Destroying them for wealth.


<tr valign=top><td>MACDUFF
<td>This avarice
<BR>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
<BR>Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been

<BR>Of your mere own: all these are portable,
<BR>With other graces weigh'd.


<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM

<BR>As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
<BR>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
<BR>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
<BR>I have no relish of them, but abound
<BR>In the division of each several crime,
<BR>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
<BR>Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,

<BR>All unity on earth.

<tr valign=top><td>MALCOLM
<td>Macduff, this noble passion,
<BR>Child of integrity, hath from my soul
<BR>Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts

<BR>By many of these trains hath sought to win me
<BR>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
<BR>From over-credulous haste: but God above

<BR>I put myself to thy direction, and
<BR>Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
<BR>The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
<BR>For strangers to my nature. I am yet

<BR>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
<BR>At no time broke my faith, would not betray
<BR>The devil to his fellow and delight
<BR>No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
<BR>Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
<BR>Is thine and my poor country's to command:
<BR>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
<BR>Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
