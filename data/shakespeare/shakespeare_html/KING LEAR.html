<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND]


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
<BR>Albany than Cornwall.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
<BR>division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
<BR>the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
<BR>weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
<BR>of either's moiety.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Is not this your son, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
<BR>so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
<BR>brazed to it.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>I cannot conceive you.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
<BR>she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
<BR>for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
<BR>Do you smell a fault?


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
<BR>being so proper.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
<BR>elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
<BR>though this knave came something saucily into the
<BR>world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
<BR>fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
<BR>whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
<BR>noble gentleman, Edmund?


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>No, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
<BR>honourable friend.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>My services to your lordship.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>I must love you, and sue to know you better.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>Sir, I shall study deserving.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
<BR>again. The king is coming.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,
<BR>GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I shall, my liege.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
<BR>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
<BR>In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
<BR>To shake all cares and business from our age;
<BR>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
<BR>Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
<BR>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
<BR>We have this hour a constant will to publish
<BR>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
<BR>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
<BR>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
<BR>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
<BR>And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
<BR>Since now we will divest us both of rule,
<BR>Interest of territory, cares of state,--
<BR>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
<BR>That we our largest bounty may extend
<BR>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
<BR>Our eldest-born, speak first.


<tr valign=top><td>GONERIL
<td>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
<BR>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
<BR>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
<BR>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
<BR>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
<BR>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
<BR>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
<BR>Love, and be silent.


<tr valign=top><td>LEAR
<td>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
<BR>With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
<BR>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
<BR>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
<BR>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
<BR>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.


<tr valign=top><td>REGAN
<td>Sir, I am made
<BR>Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
<BR>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
<BR>I find she names my very deed of love;
<BR>Only she comes too short: that I profess
<BR>Myself an enemy to all other joys,
<BR>Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
<BR>And find I am alone felicitate
<BR>In your dear highness' love.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
<BR>And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
<BR>More richer than my tongue.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>To thee and thine hereditary ever
<BR>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
<BR>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
<BR>Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
<BR>Although the last, not least; to whose young love
<BR>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
<BR>Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
<BR>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>Nothing, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Nothing!


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>Nothing.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
<BR>My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
<BR>According to my bond; nor more nor less.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
<BR>Lest it may mar your fortunes.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>Good my lord,
<BR>You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
<BR>Return those duties back as are right fit,
<BR>Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
<BR>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
<BR>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
<BR>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
<BR>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
<BR>Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
<BR>To love my father all.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>But goes thy heart with this?


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>Ay, good my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>So young, and so untender?


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>So young, my lord, and true.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
<BR>For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
<BR>The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
<BR>By all the operation of the orbs
<BR>From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
<BR>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
<BR>Propinquity and property of blood,
<BR>And as a stranger to my heart and me
<BR>Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
<BR>Or he that makes his generation messes
<BR>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
<BR>Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
<BR>As thou my sometime daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Good my liege,--


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Peace, Kent!
<BR>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
<BR>I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
<BR>On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
<BR>So be my grave my peace, as here I give
<BR>Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
<BR>Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
<BR>With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
<BR>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
<BR>I do invest you jointly with my power,
<BR>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
<BR>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
<BR>With reservation of an hundred knights,
<BR>By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
<BR>Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
<BR>The name, and all the additions to a king;
<BR>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
<BR>Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
<BR>This coronet part betwixt you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Giving the crown]


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Royal Lear,
<BR>Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
<BR>Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
<BR>As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
<BR>The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
<BR>When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
<BR>Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
<BR>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
<BR>When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
<BR>And, in thy best consideration, cheque
<BR>This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
<BR>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
<BR>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
<BR>Reverbs no hollowness.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Kent, on thy life, no more.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>My life I never held but as a pawn
<BR>To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
<BR>Thy safety being the motive.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Out of my sight!


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>See better, Lear; and let me still remain
<BR>The true blank of thine eye.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Now, by Apollo,--


<tr valign=top><td>KENT

<BR>Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR

<tr valign=top><td>KENT

<BR>Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
<BR>Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
<BR>Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
<BR>I'll tell thee thou dost evil.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Hear me, recreant!
<BR>On thine allegiance, hear me!
<BR>Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
<BR>Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
<BR>To come between our sentence and our power,
<BR>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
<BR>Our potency made good, take thy reward.
<BR>Five days we do allot thee, for provision
<BR>To shield thee from diseases of the world;
<BR>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
<BR>Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
<BR>Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
<BR>The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
<BR>This shall not be revoked.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
<BR>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To CORDELIA]

<tr valign=top><td><td>The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To REGAN and GONERIL]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And your large speeches may your deeds approve,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,
<BR>BURGUNDY, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>My lord of Burgundy.
<BR>We first address towards you, who with this king
<BR>Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
<BR>Will you require in present dower with her,
<BR>Or cease your quest of love?


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>Most royal majesty,
<BR>I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
<BR>Nor will you tender less.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Right noble Burgundy,
<BR>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
<BR>But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
<BR>If aught within that little seeming substance,
<BR>Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
<BR>And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
<BR>She's there, and she is yours.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>I know no answer.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
<BR>Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
<BR>Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
<BR>Take her, or leave her?


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>Pardon me, royal sir;
<BR>Election makes not up on such conditions.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
<BR>I tell you all her wealth.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To KING OF FRANCE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>For you, great king,
<BR>I would not from your love make such a stray,
<BR>To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
<BR>To avert your liking a more worthier way
<BR>Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
<BR>Almost to acknowledge hers.


<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE
<td>This is most strange,
<BR>That she, that even but now was your best object,
<BR>The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
<BR>Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
<BR>Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
<BR>So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
<BR>Must be of such unnatural degree,
<BR>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
<BR>Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
<BR>Must be a faith that reason without miracle
<BR>Could never plant in me.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>I yet beseech your majesty,--
<BR>If for I want that glib and oily art,
<BR>To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
<BR>I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
<BR>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
<BR>No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
<BR>That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
<BR>But even for want of that for which I am richer,
<BR>A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
<BR>As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
<BR>Hath lost me in your liking.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Better thou
<BR>Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.


<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE
<td>Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
<BR>Which often leaves the history unspoke
<BR>That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
<BR>What say you to the lady? Love's not love
<BR>When it is mingled with regards that stand
<BR>Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
<BR>She is herself a dowry.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>Royal Lear,
<BR>Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
<BR>And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
<BR>Duchess of Burgundy.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.


<tr valign=top><td>BURGUNDY
<td>I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
<BR>That you must lose a husband.


<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>Peace be with Burgundy!
<BR>Since that respects of fortune are his love,
<BR>I shall not be his wife.


<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE
<td>Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
<BR>Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
<BR>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
<BR>Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
<BR>Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
<BR>My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
<BR>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
<BR>Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
<BR>Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
<BR>Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
<BR>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
<BR>Thou losest here, a better where to find.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
<BR>Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
<BR>That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
<BR>Without our grace, our love, our benison.
<BR>Come, noble Burgundy.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL,

<tr valign=top><td>KING OF FRANCE

<tr valign=top><td>CORDELIA
<td>The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
<BR>Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;

<BR>Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:

<tr valign=top><td>REGAN

<tr valign=top><td>GONERIL
<td>You see how full of changes his age is; the
<BR>observation we have made of it hath not been
<BR>little: he always loved our sister most; and
<BR>with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
<BR>appears too grossly.


<tr valign=top><td>REGAN
<td>'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
<BR>but slenderly known himself.


<tr valign=top><td>GONERIL
<td>The best and soundest of his time hath been but
<BR>rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
<BR>not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed

<BR>that infirm and choleric years bring with them.


<tr valign=top><td>REGAN

<tr valign=top><td>GONERIL
<td>There is further compliment of leavetaking

<BR>together: if our father carry authority with

<BR>palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
<BR>and father. This villain of mine comes under the

<BR>Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
<BR>Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
<BR>That this our court, infected with their manners,
<BR>Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
<BR>Make it more like a tavern or a brothel

<BR>A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
<BR>Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
<BR>And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
<BR>Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
<BR>With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
<BR>Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
<BR>To laughter and contempt; that she may feel

<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Who's there, besides foul weather?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>One minded like the weather, most unquietly.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>I know you. Where's the king?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Contending with the fretful element:
<BR>Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
<BR>Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
<BR>That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
<BR>Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
<BR>Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
<BR>Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
<BR>The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
<BR>This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
<BR>The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
<BR>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
<BR>And bids what will take all.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>But who is with him?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
<BR>His heart-struck injuries.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Sir, I do know you;
<BR>And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
<BR>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
<BR>Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
<BR>With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
<BR>Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
<BR>Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
<BR>Which are to France the spies and speculations
<BR>Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
<BR>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
<BR>Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
<BR>Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
<BR>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
<BR>But, true it is, from France there comes a power
<BR>Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
<BR>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
<BR>In some of our best ports, and are at point
<BR>To show their open banner. Now to you:
<BR>If on my credit you dare build so far
<BR>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
<BR>Some that will thank you, making just report
<BR>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
<BR>The king hath cause to plain.
<BR>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
<BR>And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
<BR>This office to you.


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>I will talk further with you.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>No, do not.
<BR>For confirmation that I am much more
<BR>Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
<BR>What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
<BR>As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
<BR>And she will tell you who your fellow is
<BR>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
<BR>I will go seek the king.


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Give me your hand: have you no more to say?


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
<BR>That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
<BR>That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
<BR>Holla the other.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KENT and a Gentleman]


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
<BR>know you the reason?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Something he left imperfect in the
<BR>state, which since his coming forth is thought
<BR>of; which imports to the kingdom so much
<BR>fear and danger, that his personal return was
<BR>most required and necessary.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Who hath he left behind him general?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Did your letters pierce the queen to any
<BR>demonstration of grief?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
<BR>And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
<BR>Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
<BR>Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
<BR>Sought to be king o'er her.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>O, then it moved her.


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
<BR>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
<BR>Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
<BR>Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
<BR>That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
<BR>What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
<BR>As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
<BR>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
<BR>If all could so become it.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Made she no verbal question?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
<BR>Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
<BR>Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
<BR>Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
<BR>Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
<BR>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
<BR>And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
<BR>To deal with grief alone.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>It is the stars,
<BR>The stars above us, govern our conditions;
<BR>Else one self mate and mate could not beget
<BR>Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>No.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Was this before the king return'd?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>No, since.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
<BR>Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
<BR>What we are come about, and by no means
<BR>Will yield to see his daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Why, good sir?


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
<BR>That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
<BR>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
<BR>To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
<BR>His mind so venomously, that burning shame
<BR>Detains him from Cordelia.


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Alack, poor gentleman!


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>'Tis so, they are afoot.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
<BR>And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
<BR>Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
<BR>When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
<BR>Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
<BR>Along with me.

<BR>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air

<BR>The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,

<BR>the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I

<BR>Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
<BR>The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
<BR>Does lecher in my sight.
<BR>Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son

<BR>For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
<BR>Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
<BR>Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,

<BR>None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:

<BR>And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
<BR>'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
<BR>That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
<BR>I do forgive thee.


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>Let's exchange charity.
<BR>I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
<BR>If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
<BR>My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
<BR>The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
<BR>Make instruments to plague us:
<BR>The dark and vicious place where thee he got
<BR>Cost him his eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
<BR>The wheel is come full circle: I am here.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Methought thy very gait did prophesy
<BR>A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
<BR>Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
<BR>Did hate thee or thy father!


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>Worthy prince, I know't.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Where have you hid yourself?
<BR>How have you known the miseries of your father?


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
<BR>And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
<BR>The bloody proclamation to escape,
<BR>That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
<BR>That we the pain of death would hourly die
<BR>Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
<BR>Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
<BR>That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
<BR>Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
<BR>Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
<BR>Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
<BR>Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
<BR>Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
<BR>Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
<BR>I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
<BR>Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
<BR>Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
<BR>'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
<BR>Burst smilingly.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>This speech of yours hath moved me,
<BR>And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
<BR>You look as you had something more to say.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
<BR>For I am almost ready to dissolve,
<BR>Hearing of this.


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>This would have seem'd a period
<BR>To such as love not sorrow; but another,
<BR>To amplify too much, would make much more,
<BR>And top extremity.
<BR>Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
<BR>Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
<BR>Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
<BR>Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
<BR>He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
<BR>As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
<BR>Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
<BR>That ever ear received: which in recounting
<BR>His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
<BR>Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
<BR>And there I left him tranced.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>But who was this?


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
<BR>Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
<BR>Improper for a slave.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife]


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Help, help, O, help!


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>What kind of help?


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Speak, man.


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>What means that bloody knife?


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>'Tis hot, it smokes;
<BR>It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Who dead? speak, man.


<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman
<td>Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
<BR>By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>I was contracted to them both: all three
<BR>Now marry in an instant.


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>Here comes Kent.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
<BR>This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
<BR>Touches us not with pity.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Gentleman]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KENT]

<tr valign=top><td><td>O, is this he?
<BR>The time will not allow the compliment
<BR>Which very manners urges.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>I am come
<BR>To bid my king and master aye good night:
<BR>Is he not here?


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Great thing of us forgot!
<BR>Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
<BR>See'st thou this object, Kent?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in]


<tr valign=top><td>KENT
<td>Alack, why thus?


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>Yet Edmund was beloved:
<BR>The one the other poison'd for my sake,
<BR>And after slew herself.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Even so. Cover their faces.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
<BR>Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
<BR>Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
<BR>Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
<BR>Nay, send in time.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Run, run, O, run!


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
<BR>Thy token of reprieve.


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>Well thought on: take my sword,
<BR>Give it the captain.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>Haste thee, for thy life.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit EDGAR]


<tr valign=top><td>EDMUND
<td>He hath commission from thy wife and me
<BR>To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
<BR>To lay the blame upon her own despair,
<BR>That she fordid herself.


<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY
<td>The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[EDMUND is borne off]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms;

<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
<BR>Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
<BR>That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
<BR>I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
<BR>She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
<BR>If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
<BR>Why, then she lives.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT

<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR

<tr valign=top><td>ALBANY

<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR

<tr valign=top><td>KENT

<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>Prithee, away.


<tr valign=top><td>EDGAR
<td>'Tis noble Kent, your friend.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
<BR>I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
<BR>Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
<BR>What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
<BR>Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
<BR>I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

<BR>I would have made them skip: I am old now,
<BR>And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
<BR>Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT

<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR
<td>He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
<BR>He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.


<tr valign=top><td>KENT

<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR

<tr valign=top><td>KING LEAR

<tr valign=top><td>KENT
