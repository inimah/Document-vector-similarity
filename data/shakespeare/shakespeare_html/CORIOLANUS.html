<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen

<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.


<tr valign=top><td>All

<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
<BR>Is't a verdict?


<tr valign=top><td>All
<td>No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!


<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen
<td>One word, good citizens.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
<BR>What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
<BR>would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
<BR>wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
<BR>but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
<BR>afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
<BR>inventory to particularise their abundance; our
<BR>sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
<BR>our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
<BR>speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen
<td>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?


<tr valign=top><td>All
<td>Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen
<td>Consider you what services he has done for his country?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Very well; and could be content to give him good
<BR>report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen
<td>Nay, but speak not maliciously.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
<BR>it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
<BR>content to say it was for his country he did it to
<BR>please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
<BR>is, even till the altitude of his virtue.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen
<td>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
<BR>vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
<BR>he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Shouts within]

<tr valign=top><td><td>What shouts are these? The other side o' the city

<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen

<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
<BR>With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
<BR>had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
<BR>which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
<BR>suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
<BR>have strong arms too.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
<BR>Will you undo yourselves?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>I tell you, friends, most charitable care
<BR>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
<BR>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
<BR>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
<BR>Against the Roman state, whose course will on
<BR>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
<BR>Of more strong link asunder than can ever
<BR>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
<BR>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
<BR>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
<BR>You are transported by calamity
<BR>Thither where more attends you, and you slander
<BR>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
<BR>When you curse them as enemies.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
<BR>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
<BR>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
<BR>support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
<BR>established against the rich, and provide more
<BR>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
<BR>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
<BR>there's all the love they bear us.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Either you must
<BR>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
<BR>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
<BR>A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
<BR>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
<BR>To stale 't a little more.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
<BR>fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
<BR>you, deliver.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>There was a time when all the body's members
<BR>Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
<BR>That only like a gulf it did remain
<BR>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
<BR>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
<BR>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
<BR>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
<BR>And, mutually participate, did minister
<BR>Unto the appetite and affection common
<BR>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
<BR>Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
<BR>For, look you, I may make the belly smile
<BR>As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
<BR>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
<BR>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
<BR>As you malign our senators for that
<BR>They are not such as you.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Your belly's answer? What!
<BR>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
<BR>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
<BR>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
<BR>With other muniments and petty helps
<BR>In this our fabric, if that they--


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>What then?
<BR>'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
<BR>Who is the sink o' the body,--


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Well, what then?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>The former agents, if they did complain,
<BR>What could the belly answer?


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>I will tell you
<BR>If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
<BR>Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Ye're long about it.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Note me this, good friend;
<BR>Your most grave belly was deliberate,
<BR>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
<BR>'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
<BR>'That I receive the general food at first,
<BR>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
<BR>Because I am the store-house and the shop
<BR>Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
<BR>I send it through the rivers of your blood,
<BR>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
<BR>And, through the cranks and offices of man,
<BR>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
<BR>From me receive that natural competency
<BR>Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
<BR>You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Ay, sir; well, well.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>'Though all at once cannot
<BR>See what I do deliver out to each,
<BR>Yet I can make my audit up, that all
<BR>From me do back receive the flour of all,
<BR>And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>It was an answer: how apply you this?


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>The senators of Rome are this good belly,
<BR>And you the mutinous members; for examine
<BR>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
<BR>Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
<BR>No public benefit which you receive
<BR>But it proceeds or comes from them to you
<BR>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
<BR>You, the great toe of this assembly?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>I the great toe! why the great toe?


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
<BR>Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
<BR>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
<BR>Lead'st first to win some vantage.
<BR>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
<BR>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
<BR>The one side must have bale.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CAIUS MARCIUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Hail, noble Marcius!


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS
<td>Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
<BR>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
<BR>Make yourselves scabs?


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>We have ever your good word.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS
<td>He that will give good words to thee will flatter
<BR>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
<BR>That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
<BR>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
<BR>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
<BR>Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
<BR>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
<BR>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
<BR>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
<BR>And curse that justice did it.
<BR>Who deserves greatness
<BR>Deserves your hate; and your affections are
<BR>A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
<BR>Which would increase his evil. He that depends
<BR>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
<BR>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
<BR>With every minute you do change a mind,
<BR>And call him noble that was now your hate,
<BR>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
<BR>That in these several places of the city
<BR>You cry against the noble senate, who,
<BR>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
<BR>Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
<BR>The city is well stored.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS
<td>Hang 'em! They say!
<BR>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
<BR>What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
<BR>Who thrives and who declines; side factions
<BR>and give out
<BR>Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
<BR>And feebling such as stand not in their liking
<BR>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
<BR>grain enough!
<BR>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
<BR>And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
<BR>With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
<BR>As I could pick my lance.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
<BR>For though abundantly they lack discretion,
<BR>Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
<BR>What says the other troop?


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS
<td>They are dissolved: hang 'em!
<BR>They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
<BR>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
<BR>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
<BR>Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
<BR>They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
<BR>And a petition granted them, a strange one--
<BR>To break the heart of generosity,
<BR>And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
<BR>As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
<BR>Shouting their emulation.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>What is granted them?


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS
<td>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
<BR>Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
<BR>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
<BR>The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
<BR>Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
<BR>Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
<BR>For insurrection's arguing.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>This is strange.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Messenger, hastily]

<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS

<BR>Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators;
<BR>JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS]


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
<BR>The Volsces are in arms.


<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS
<td>They have a leader,
<BR>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
<BR>I sin in envying his nobility,

<tr valign=top><td>MARCIUS

<BR>Attend upon Cominius to these wars.


<tr valign=top><td>COMINIUS

<tr valign=top><td>SICINIUS

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<tr valign=top><td>SICINIUS
<td>Such a nature,
<BR>Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
<BR>Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
<BR>His insolence can brook to be commanded
<BR>Under Cominius.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<tr valign=top><td>SICINIUS

<BR>should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
<BR>won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
<BR>he would show most love. When yet he was but
<BR>tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
<BR>youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
<BR>for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
<BR>sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
<BR>how honour would become such a person. that it was
<BR>no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
<BR>renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
<BR>danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
<BR>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
<BR>bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
<BR>more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
<BR>than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
<BR>man.


<tr valign=top><td>VIRGILIA

<BR>you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink

<BR>so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
<BR>cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
<BR>saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
<BR>who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
<BR>since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the

<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS
<td>No, sir: yet oft,

<BR>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
<BR>That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
<BR>He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
<BR>Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.


<tr valign=top><td>COMINIUS
<td>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
<BR>Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
<BR>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
<BR>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
<BR>The man I speak of cannot in the world
<BR>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
<BR>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
<BR>Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
<BR>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
<BR>When with his Amazonian chin he drove
<BR>The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
<BR>An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
<BR>Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
<BR>And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
<BR>When he might act the woman in the scene,
<BR>He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
<BR>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
<BR>Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
<BR>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
<BR>He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
<BR>Before and in Corioli, let me say,
<BR>I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
<BR>And by his rare example made the coward
<BR>Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
<BR>A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
<BR>And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
<BR>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
<BR>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
<BR>Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
<BR>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
<BR>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
<BR>And with a sudden reinforcement struck
<BR>Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
<BR>When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
<BR>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
<BR>Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
<BR>And to the battle came he; where he did
<BR>Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
<BR>'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
<BR>Both field and city ours, he never stood
<BR>To ease his breast with panting.

<tr valign=top><td>First Senator

<BR>Which we devise him.


<tr valign=top><td>COMINIUS
<td>Our spoils he kick'd at,
<BR>And look'd upon things precious as they were
<BR>The common muck of the world: he covets less
<BR>Than misery itself would give; rewards
<BR>His deeds with doing them, and is content
<BR>To spend the time to end it.

<tr valign=top><td>COMINIUS
<td>'Twas from the canon.


<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS
<td>'Shall'!
<BR>O good but most unwise patricians! why,
<BR>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
<BR>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
<BR>That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
<BR>The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
<BR>To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
<BR>And make your channel his? If he have power
<BR>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
<BR>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
<BR>Be not as common fools; if you are not,
<BR>Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
<BR>If they be senators: and they are no less,
<BR>When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
<BR>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
<BR>And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
<BR>His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
<BR>Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
<BR>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
<BR>To know, when two authorities are up,
<BR>Neither supreme, how soon confusion
<BR>May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
<BR>The one by the other.


<tr valign=top><td>COMINIUS
<td>Well, on to the market-place.


<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS

<BR>The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
<BR>Sometime in Greece,--


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Well, well, no more of that.


<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS
<td>Though there the people had more absolute power,
<BR>I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
<BR>The ruin of the state.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Why, shall the people give
<BR>One that speaks thus their voice?


<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS
<td>I'll give my reasons,
<BR>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
<BR>Was not our recompense, resting well assured
<BR>That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
<BR>Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
<BR>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
<BR>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
<BR>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
<BR>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
<BR>Which they have often made against the senate,
<BR>All cause unborn, could never be the motive
<BR>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
<BR>How shall this bisson multitude digest
<BR>The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
<BR>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
<BR>We are the greater poll, and in true fear
<BR>They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
<BR>The nature of our seats and make the rabble
<BR>Call our cares fears; which will in time
<BR>Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
<BR>The crows to peck the eagles.


<tr valign=top><td>MENENIUS
<td>Come, enough.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Enough, with over-measure.


<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS
<td>No, take more:
<BR>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
<BR>Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
<BR>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
<BR>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
<BR>Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
<BR>Of general ignorance,--it must omit
<BR>Real necessities, and give way the while
<BR>To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
<BR>it follows,
<BR>Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
<BR>You that will be less fearful than discreet,
<BR>That love the fundamental part of state
<BR>More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
<BR>A noble life before a long, and wish
<BR>To jump a body with a dangerous physic
<BR>That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
<BR>The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
<BR>The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
<BR>Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
<BR>Of that integrity which should become't,
<BR>Not having the power to do the good it would,
<BR>For the in which doth control't.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<BR>As traitors do.


<tr valign=top><td>CORIOLANUS

<BR>What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
<BR>On whom depending, their obedience fails
<BR>To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
<BR>When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
<BR>Then were they chosen: in a better hour,

<tr valign=top><td>Volsce
<td>You had more beard when I last saw you; but your

<BR>to find you out there: you have well saved me a

<tr valign=top><td>Roman
<td>There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
<BR>people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.


<tr valign=top><td>Volsce
<td>Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
<BR>so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
<BR>hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.


<tr valign=top><td>Roman
<td>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
<BR>would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
<BR>so to heart the banishment of that worthy
<BR>Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
<BR>all power from the people and to pluck from them
<BR>their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
<BR>tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
<BR>breaking out.


<tr valign=top><td>Volsce
<td>Coriolanus banished!


<tr valign=top><td>Roman
<td>Banished, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>Volsce
<td>You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.


<tr valign=top><td>Roman
<td>The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
<BR>said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
<BR>when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
<BR>Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
<BR>great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
<BR>of his country.

<td>He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
<BR>accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my

<td>I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
<BR>strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
<BR>their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?


<tr valign=top><td>Volsce
<td>A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,

<BR>and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

<BR>As hotly and as nobly with thy love
<BR>As ever in ambitious strength I did

<BR>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
<BR>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
<BR>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
<BR>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
<BR>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
<BR>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
<BR>Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;

<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman
<td>Why do you say 'thwack our general '?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servingman
<td>I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always

<tr valign=top><td>Second Servingman
<td>Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
<BR>hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.


<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman
<td>He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth

<tr valign=top><td>Second Servingman
<td>An he had been cannibally given, he might have

<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman

<tr valign=top><td>Third Servingman
<td>Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son

<BR>question asked him by any of the senators, but they
<BR>stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
<BR>mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
<BR>turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
<BR>the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
<BR>the middle and but one half of what he was
<BR>yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
<BR>and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
<BR>and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
<BR>will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Servingman
<td>And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servingman
<td>Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as

<BR>were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
<BR>we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.


<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman
<td>Directitude! what's that?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servingman
<td>But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
<BR>and the man in blood, they will out of their

<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman
<td>But when goes this forward?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servingman
<td>To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
<BR>drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
<BR>parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
<BR>wipe their lips.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Servingman
<td>Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
<BR>This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
<BR>tailors, and breed ballad-makers.


<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman
<td>Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
<BR>day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
<BR>full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
<BR>mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
<BR>bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Servingman
<td>'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
<BR>be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
<BR>great maker of cuckolds.


<tr valign=top><td>First Servingman

<tr valign=top><td>Third Servingman

<tr valign=top><td>COMINIUS

<BR>The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people

<tr valign=top><td>Lieutenant

<BR>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
<BR>By sovereignty of nature. First he was
<BR>A noble servant to them; but he could not

<BR>To fail in the disposing of those chances
<BR>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
<BR>Not to be other than one thing, not moving
<BR>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
<BR>Even with the same austerity and garb
<BR>As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
<BR>As he hath spices of them all, not all,
<BR>For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
<BR>So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
<BR>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
<BR>Lie in the interpretation of the time:
<BR>And power, unto itself most commendable,
<BR>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
<BR>To extol what it hath done.
<BR>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
<BR>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.

<BR>That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
<BR>To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
<BR>Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
<BR>To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
<BR>Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
<BR>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
<BR>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
<BR>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
<BR>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
<BR>Does reason our petition with more strength
<BR>Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
