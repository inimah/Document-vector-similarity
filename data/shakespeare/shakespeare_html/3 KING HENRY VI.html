<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK,
<BR>MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers]


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>I wonder how the king escaped our hands.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
<BR>He slily stole away and left his men:
<BR>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
<BR>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
<BR>Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
<BR>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
<BR>Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
<BR>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.


<tr valign=top><td>EDWARD
<td>Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
<BR>Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
<BR>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
<BR>That this is true, father, behold his blood.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
<BR>Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Throwing down SOMERSET's head]


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
<BR>But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
<BR>Before I see thee seated in that throne
<BR>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
<BR>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
<BR>This is the palace of the fearful king,
<BR>And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
<BR>For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
<BR>For hither we have broken in by force.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
<BR>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They go up]


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>And when the king comes, offer no violence,
<BR>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>The queen this day here holds her parliament,
<BR>But little thinks we shall be of her council:
<BR>By words or blows here let us win our right.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
<BR>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
<BR>And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
<BR>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
<BR>I mean to take possession of my right.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
<BR>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
<BR>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
<BR>I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
<BR>Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD,
<BR>NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
<BR>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
<BR>Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
<BR>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
<BR>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
<BR>And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
<BR>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
<BR>My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
<BR>He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
<BR>My gracious lord, here in the parliament
<BR>Let us assail the family of York.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Ah, know you not the city favours them,
<BR>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
<BR>To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
<BR>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
<BR>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
<BR>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
<BR>and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
<BR>I am thy sovereign.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>I am thine.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
<BR>In following this usurping Henry.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>Whom should he follow but his natural king?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>It must and shall be so: content thyself.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
<BR>And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
<BR>That we are those which chased you from the field
<BR>And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
<BR>March'd through the city to the palace gates.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
<BR>And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
<BR>Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
<BR>Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
<BR>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
<BR>As shall revenge his death before I stir.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Will you we show our title to the crown?
<BR>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
<BR>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
<BR>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
<BR>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
<BR>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
<BR>And seized upon their towns and provinces.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>The lord protector lost it, and not I:
<BR>When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
<BR>Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.


<tr valign=top><td>EDWARD
<td>Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
<BR>Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Sons, peace!


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
<BR>And be you silent and attentive too,
<BR>For he that interrupts him shall not live.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
<BR>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
<BR>No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
<BR>Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
<BR>And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
<BR>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
<BR>My title's good, and better far than his.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>'Twas by rebellion against his king.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
<BR>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>What then?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>An if he may, then am I lawful king;
<BR>For Richard, in the view of many lords,
<BR>Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
<BR>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>He rose against him, being his sovereign,
<BR>And made him to resign his crown perforce.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
<BR>Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>No; for he could not so resign his crown
<BR>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
<BR>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
<BR>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
<BR>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
<BR>Can set the duke up in despite of me.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
<BR>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
<BR>May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
<BR>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
<BR>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
<BR>Or I will fill the house with armed men,
<BR>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
<BR>Write up his title with usurping blood.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
<BR>themselves]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
<BR>Let me for this my life-time reign as king.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
<BR>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
<BR>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>What wrong is this unto the prince your son!


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>What good is this to England and himself!


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>Base, fearful and despairing Henry!


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>How hast thou injured both thyself and us!


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>I cannot stay to hear these articles.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Nor I.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
<BR>In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
<BR>And die in bands for this unmanly deed!


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
<BR>Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND]


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Ah, Exeter!


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Why should you sigh, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
<BR>Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
<BR>But be it as it may: I here entail
<BR>The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
<BR>Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
<BR>To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
<BR>To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
<BR>And neither by treason nor hostility
<BR>To seek to put me down and reign thyself.


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>This oath I willingly take and will perform.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>And long live thou and these thy forward sons!


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Sennet. Here they come down]


<tr valign=top><td>YORK
<td>Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>And I'll keep London with my soldiers.


<tr valign=top><td>NORFOLK
<td>And I to Norfolk with my followers.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>And I unto the sea from whence I came.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD,
<BR>WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and
<BR>Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER
<td>Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
<BR>I'll steal away.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Exeter, so will I.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Who can be patient in such extremes?
<BR>Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
<BR>And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
<BR>Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
<BR>Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
<BR>Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
<BR>Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
<BR>Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
<BR>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
<BR>Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
<BR>And disinherited thine only son.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE EDWARD
<td>Father, you cannot disinherit me:
<BR>If you be king, why should not I succeed?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
<BR>The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
<BR>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
<BR>Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
<BR>And given unto the house of York such head
<BR>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
<BR>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
<BR>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
<BR>And creep into it far before thy time?
<BR>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
<BR>Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
<BR>The duke is made protector of the realm;
<BR>And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
<BR>The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
<BR>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
<BR>The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
<BR>Before I would have granted to that act.
<BR>But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
<BR>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
<BR>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
<BR>Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
<BR>Whereby my son is disinherited.
<BR>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
<BR>Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
<BR>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
<BR>And utter ruin of the house of York.
<BR>Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
<BR>Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE EDWARD
<td>When I return with victory from the field
<BR>I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
<BR>Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
<BR>Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
<BR>Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
<BR>Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
<BR>Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
<BR>The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
<BR>I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
<BR>Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.


<tr valign=top><td>EXETER

<BR>But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
<BR>And we in them no hope to win the day;
<BR>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
<BR>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
<BR>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
<BR>For in the marches here we heard you were,
<BR>Making another head to fight again.


<tr valign=top><td>EDWARD
<td>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
<BR>And when came George from Burgundy to England?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
<BR>And for your brother, he was lately sent
<BR>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
<BR>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
<BR>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
<BR>But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
<BR>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
<BR>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
<BR>And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
<BR>Were he as famous and as bold in war
<BR>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
<BR>'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
<BR>But in this troublous time what's to be done?
<BR>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
<BR>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
<BR>Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
<BR>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
<BR>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
<BR>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
<BR>And therefore comes my brother Montague.
<BR>Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
<BR>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
<BR>And of their feather many more proud birds,
<BR>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
<BR>He swore consent to your succession,
<BR>His oath enrolled in the parliament;
<BR>And now to London all the crew are gone,
<BR>To frustrate both his oath and what beside
<BR>May make against the house of Lancaster.
<BR>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
<BR>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
<BR>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
<BR>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
<BR>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
<BR>Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
<BR>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
<BR>And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
<BR>But never once again turn back and fly.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD
<td>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
<BR>Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
<BR>That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.


<tr valign=top><td>EDWARD
<td>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
<BR>And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
<BR>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
<BR>The next degree is England's royal throne;
<BR>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
<BR>In every borough as we pass along;
<BR>And he that throws not up his cap for joy
<BR>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
<BR>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
<BR>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
<BR>But sound the trumpets, and about our task.


<tr valign=top><td>RICHARD

<BR>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
<BR>To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
<BR>Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
<BR>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.


<tr valign=top><td>CLIFFORD
<td>My gracious liege, this too much lenity
<BR>And harmful pity must be laid aside.
<BR>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
<BR>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
<BR>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
<BR>Not his that spoils her young before her face.
<BR>Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
<BR>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
<BR>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
<BR>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
<BR>Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
<BR>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
<BR>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
<BR>And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
<BR>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
<BR>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
<BR>Which argued thee a most unloving father.
<BR>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
<BR>And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
<BR>Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
<BR>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
<BR>Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
<BR>Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
<BR>Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
<BR>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
<BR>Were it not pity that this goodly boy
<BR>Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
<BR>And long hereafter say unto his child,
<BR>'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
<BR>My careless father fondly gave away'?
<BR>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
<BR>And let his manly face, which promiseth
<BR>Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
<BR>To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

<BR>But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear

<BR>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
<BR>I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
<BR>And would my father had left me no more!
<BR>For all the rest is held at such a rate

<BR>That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
<BR>And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
<BR>For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
<BR>Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;

<BR>Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

<BR>O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
<BR>More than my body's parting with my soul!
<BR>My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
<BR>And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
<BR>Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
<BR>The common people swarm like summer flies;
<BR>And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
<BR>And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
<BR>O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
<BR>That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
<BR>Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
<BR>And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
<BR>Or as thy father and his father did,
<BR>Giving no ground unto the house of York,
<BR>They never then had sprung like summer flies;
<BR>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
<BR>Had left no mourning widows for our death;
<BR>And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
<BR>For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
<BR>And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
<BR>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
<BR>No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
<BR>The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
<BR>For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
<BR>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
<BR>And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
<BR>Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;

<BR>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
<BR>I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,

<BR>That I in all despite might rail at him,
<BR>This hand should chop it off, and with the

<BR>That carries no impression like the dam.
<BR>And am I then a man to be beloved?
<BR>O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
<BR>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
<BR>But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
<BR>As are of better person than myself,
<BR>I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
<BR>And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
<BR>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
<BR>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
<BR>And yet I know not how to get the crown,
<BR>For many lives stand between me and home:
<BR>And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
<BR>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
<BR>Seeking a way and straying from the way;
<BR>Not knowing how to find the open air,
<BR>But toiling desperately to find it out,--
<BR>Torment myself to catch the English crown:
<BR>And from that torment I will free myself,
<BR>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
<BR>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
<BR>And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
<BR>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
<BR>And frame my face to all occasions.
<BR>I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
<BR>I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
<BR>I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
<BR>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
<BR>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
<BR>I can add colours to the chameleon,
<BR>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
<BR>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
<BR>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
<BR>Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,
<BR>his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN
<BR>MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and
<BR>riseth up again]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
<BR>Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
<BR>And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
<BR>Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
<BR>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
<BR>Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
<BR>But now mischance hath trod my title down,
<BR>And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
<BR>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
<BR>And to my humble seat conform myself.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
<BR>And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
<BR>And sit thee by our side:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Seats her by him]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Yield not thy neck
<BR>To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
<BR>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
<BR>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
<BR>It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
<BR>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
<BR>Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
<BR>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
<BR>Is of a king become a banish'd man,
<BR>And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
<BR>While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
<BR>Usurps the regal title and the seat
<BR>Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
<BR>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
<BR>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
<BR>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
<BR>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
<BR>Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
<BR>Our people and our peers are both misled,
<BR>Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
<BR>And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
<BR>While we bethink a means to break it off.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
<BR>And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter WARWICK]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[He descends. She ariseth]


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
<BR>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
<BR>My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
<BR>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
<BR>First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
<BR>And then to crave a league of amity;
<BR>And lastly, to confirm that amity
<BR>With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
<BR>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
<BR>To England's king in lawful marriage.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
<BR>I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
<BR>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
<BR>To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
<BR>Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
<BR>Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
<BR>Before you answer Warwick. His demand
<BR>Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
<BR>But from deceit bred by necessity;
<BR>For how can tyrants safely govern home,
<BR>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
<BR>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
<BR>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
<BR>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
<BR>Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
<BR>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
<BR>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
<BR>Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Injurious Margaret!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE EDWARD
<td>And why not queen?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Because thy father Henry did usurp;
<BR>And thou no more are prince than she is queen.


<tr valign=top><td>OXFORD
<td>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
<BR>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
<BR>And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
<BR>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
<BR>And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
<BR>Who by his prowess conquered all France:
<BR>From these our Henry lineally descends.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
<BR>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
<BR>All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
<BR>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
<BR>But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
<BR>Of threescore and two years; a silly time
<BR>To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.


<tr valign=top><td>OXFORD
<td>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
<BR>Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
<BR>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
<BR>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
<BR>For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.


<tr valign=top><td>OXFORD
<td>Call him my king by whose injurious doom
<BR>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
<BR>Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
<BR>Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
<BR>When nature brought him to the door of death?
<BR>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
<BR>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>And I the house of York.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
<BR>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
<BR>While I use further conference with Warwick.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They stand aloof]


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
<BR>Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
<BR>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>But is he gracious in the people's eye?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>The more that Henry was unfortunate.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Then further, all dissembling set aside,
<BR>Tell me for truth the measure of his love
<BR>Unto our sister Bona.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Such it seems
<BR>As may beseem a monarch like himself.
<BR>Myself have often heard him say and swear
<BR>That this his love was an eternal plant,
<BR>Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
<BR>The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
<BR>Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
<BR>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.


<tr valign=top><td>BONA
<td>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To WARWICK]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Yet I confess that often ere this day,
<BR>When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
<BR>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
<BR>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
<BR>Touching the jointure that your king must make,
<BR>Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
<BR>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
<BR>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE EDWARD
<td>To Edward, but not to the English king.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
<BR>By this alliance to make void my suit:
<BR>Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>And still is friend to him and Margaret:
<BR>But if your title to the crown be weak,
<BR>As may appear by Edward's good success,
<BR>Then 'tis but reason that I be released
<BR>From giving aid which late I promised.
<BR>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
<BR>That your estate requires and mine can yield.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
<BR>Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
<BR>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
<BR>You have a father able to maintain you;
<BR>And better 'twere you troubled him than France.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
<BR>Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
<BR>I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
<BR>Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
<BR>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
<BR>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Post blows a horn within]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Post]


<tr valign=top><td>Post
<td>[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
<BR>Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To KING LEWIS XI]

<tr valign=top><td><td>These from our king unto your majesty:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To QUEEN MARGARET]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They all read their letters]


<tr valign=top><td>OXFORD
<td>I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
<BR>Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE EDWARD
<td>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
<BR>I hope all's for the best.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
<BR>And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
<BR>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
<BR>Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
<BR>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>I told your majesty as much before:
<BR>This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
<BR>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
<BR>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
<BR>No more my king, for he dishonours me,
<BR>But most himself, if he could see his shame.
<BR>Did I forget that by the house of York
<BR>My father came untimely to his death?
<BR>Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
<BR>Did I impale him with the regal crown?
<BR>Did I put Henry from his native right?
<BR>And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
<BR>Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
<BR>And to repair my honour lost for him,
<BR>I here renounce him and return to Henry.
<BR>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
<BR>And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
<BR>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
<BR>And replant Henry in his former state.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
<BR>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
<BR>And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
<BR>That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
<BR>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
<BR>I'll undertake to land them on our coast
<BR>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
<BR>'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
<BR>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
<BR>He's very likely now to fall from him,
<BR>For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
<BR>Or than for strength and safety of our country.


<tr valign=top><td>BONA
<td>Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
<BR>But by thy help to this distressed queen?


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
<BR>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?


<tr valign=top><td>BONA
<td>My quarrel and this English queen's are one.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
<BR>Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
<BR>You shall have aid.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Let me give humble thanks for all at once.


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>Then, England's messenger, return in post,
<BR>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
<BR>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
<BR>To revel it with him and his new bride:
<BR>Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.


<tr valign=top><td>BONA
<td>Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
<BR>I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN MARGARET
<td>Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
<BR>And I am ready to put armour on.


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
<BR>And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
<BR>There's thy reward: be gone.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Post]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI
<td>But, Warwick,
<BR>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
<BR>Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
<BR>And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
<BR>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
<BR>Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
<BR>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK
<td>This shall assure my constant loyalty,
<BR>That if our queen and this young prince agree,

<td>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
<BR>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
<BR>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
<BR>And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
<BR>That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE EDWARD
<td>Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
<BR>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[He gives his hand to WARWICK]


<tr valign=top><td>KING LEWIS XI

<BR>I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
<BR>For mocking marriage with a dame of France.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but WARWICK]


<tr valign=top><td>WARWICK

<BR>But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
<BR>Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
<BR>But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
<BR>Had he none else to make a stale but me?
<BR>Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
<BR>I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
<BR>And I'll be chief to bring him down again:

<BR>'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
<BR>What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
<BR>Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
<BR>Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;

<BR>To make a bloody supper in the Tower.


<tr valign=top><td>KING EDWARD IV
<td>He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
<BR>Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
<BR>With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
<BR>And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
<BR>By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.

<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
<BR>'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
<BR>'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
<BR>And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Lieutenant]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
<BR>So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
<BR>And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
<BR>What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
<BR>The thief doth fear each bush an officer.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
<BR>With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
<BR>And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
<BR>Have now the fatal object in my eye
<BR>Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
<BR>That taught his son the office of a fowl!
<BR>An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
<BR>Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
<BR>The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
<BR>Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
<BR>Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
<BR>Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
<BR>My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
<BR>Than can my ears that tragic history.
<BR>But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Think'st thou I am an executioner?


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
<BR>If murdering innocents be executing,
<BR>Why, then thou art an executioner.


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
<BR>Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
<BR>And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
<BR>Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
<BR>And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
<BR>And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
<BR>Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
<BR>And orphans for their parents timeless death--
<BR>Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
<BR>The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
<BR>The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
<BR>Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
<BR>The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
<BR>And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
<BR>Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
<BR>And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
<BR>To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
<BR>Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
<BR>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
<BR>To signify thou camest to bite the world:
<BR>And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
<BR>Thou camest--


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Stabs him]

<tr valign=top><td><td>For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY VI
<td>Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
<BR>God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Dies]


<tr valign=top><td>GLOUCESTER
<td>What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
<BR>Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
<BR>See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
<BR>O, may such purple tears be alway shed
<BR>From those that wish the downfall of our house!
<BR>If any spark of life be yet remaining,
<BR>Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Stabs him again]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
<BR>Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
<BR>For I have often heard my mother say
<BR>I came into the world with my legs forward:
<BR>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
<BR>And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
<BR>The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
<BR>'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
<BR>And so I was; which plainly signified
<BR>That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
<BR>Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
<BR>Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
<BR>I have no brother, I am like no brother;
<BR>And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
<BR>Be resident in men like one another
<BR>And not in me: I am myself alone.
<BR>Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
<BR>But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
<BR>For I will buz abroad such prophecies
<BR>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
<BR>And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
<BR>King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
<BR>Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
<BR>Counting myself but bad till I be best.
<BR>I'll throw thy body in another room
<BR>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.

<td>Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
<BR>Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
<BR>What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
<BR>Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
<BR>Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
<BR>For hardy and undoubted champions;
<BR>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
<BR>And two Northumberlands; two braver men
<BR>Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
<BR>With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
<BR>That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
<BR>And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
<BR>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
<BR>And made our footstool of security.
<BR>Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
<BR>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
<BR>Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
<BR>Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
<BR>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
<BR>And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.

<BR>Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.


<tr valign=top><td>KING EDWARD IV
<td>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
<BR>And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.


<tr valign=top><td>CLARENCE
