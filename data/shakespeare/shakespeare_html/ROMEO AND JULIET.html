<BR>armed with swords and bucklers]


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>No, for then we should be colliers.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>I strike quickly, being moved.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
<BR>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
<BR>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
<BR>to the wall.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
<BR>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
<BR>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
<BR>to the wall.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
<BR>have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
<BR>maids, and cut off their heads.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>The heads of the maids?


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
<BR>take it in what sense thou wilt.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>They must take it in sense that feel it.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
<BR>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
<BR>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
<BR>two of the house of the Montagues.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>How! turn thy back and run?


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Fear me not.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>No, marry; I fear thee!


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY
<td>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
<BR>they list.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
<BR>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]

<td>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON

<BR>bite my thumb, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY

<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Well, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>GREGORY

<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Yes, better, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>ABRAHAM
<td>You lie.


<tr valign=top><td>SAMPSON
<td>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They fight]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BENVOLIO]


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Part, fools!
<BR>Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Beats down their swords]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter TYBALT]


<tr valign=top><td>TYBALT
<td>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
<BR>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
<BR>Or manage it to part these men with me.


<tr valign=top><td>TYBALT
<td>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
<BR>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
<BR>Have at thee, coward!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They fight]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
<BR>then enter Citizens, with clubs]


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen
<td>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
<BR>Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]


<tr valign=top><td>CAPULET
<td>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!


<tr valign=top><td>LADY CAPULET
<td>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?


<tr valign=top><td>CAPULET
<td>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
<BR>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY MONTAGUE
<td>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
<BR>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
<BR>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
<BR>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
<BR>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
<BR>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
<BR>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
<BR>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
<BR>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
<BR>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
<BR>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
<BR>And made Verona's ancient citizens
<BR>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
<BR>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
<BR>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
<BR>If ever you disturb our streets again,
<BR>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
<BR>For this time, all the rest depart away:
<BR>You Capulet; shall go along with me:
<BR>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
<BR>To know our further pleasure in this case,
<BR>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
<BR>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
<BR>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Here were the servants of your adversary,
<BR>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
<BR>I drew to part them: in the instant came
<BR>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
<BR>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
<BR>He swung about his head and cut the winds,
<BR>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
<BR>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
<BR>Came more and more and fought on part and part,
<BR>Till the prince came, who parted either part.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY MONTAGUE
<td>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
<BR>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
<BR>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
<BR>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
<BR>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
<BR>That westward rooteth from the city's side,
<BR>So early walking did I see your son:
<BR>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
<BR>And stole into the covert of the wood:
<BR>I, measuring his affections by my own,
<BR>That most are busied when they're most alone,
<BR>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
<BR>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>Many a morning hath he there been seen,
<BR>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
<BR>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
<BR>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
<BR>Should in the furthest east begin to draw
<BR>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
<BR>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
<BR>And private in his chamber pens himself,
<BR>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
<BR>And makes himself an artificial night:
<BR>Black and portentous must this humour prove,
<BR>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>I neither know it nor can learn of him.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Have you importuned him by any means?


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>Both by myself and many other friends:
<BR>But he, his own affections' counsellor,
<BR>Is to himself--I will not say how true--
<BR>But to himself so secret and so close,
<BR>So far from sounding and discovery,
<BR>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
<BR>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
<BR>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
<BR>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
<BR>We would as willingly give cure as know.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ROMEO]


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
<BR>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
<BR>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Good-morrow, cousin.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Is the day so young?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>But new struck nine.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Ay me! sad hours seem long.
<BR>Was that my father that went hence so fast?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>In love?


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Out--


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Of love?


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Out of her favour, where I am in love.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
<BR>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
<BR>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
<BR>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
<BR>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
<BR>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
<BR>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
<BR>O any thing, of nothing first create!
<BR>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
<BR>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
<BR>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
<BR>sick health!
<BR>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
<BR>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
<BR>Dost thou not laugh?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>No, coz, I rather weep.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Good heart, at what?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>At thy good heart's oppression.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Why, such is love's transgression.
<BR>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
<BR>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
<BR>With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
<BR>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
<BR>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
<BR>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
<BR>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
<BR>What is it else? a madness most discreet,
<BR>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
<BR>Farewell, my coz.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Soft! I will go along;
<BR>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
<BR>This is not Romeo, he's some other where.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>What, shall I groan and tell thee?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Groan! why, no.
<BR>But sadly tell me who.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
<BR>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
<BR>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
<BR>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
<BR>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
<BR>From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
<BR>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
<BR>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
<BR>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
<BR>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
<BR>That when she dies with beauty dies her store.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
<BR>For beauty starved with her severity
<BR>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
<BR>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
<BR>To merit bliss by making me despair:
<BR>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
<BR>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>O, teach me how I should forget to think.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
<BR>Examine other beauties.


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>'Tis the way
<BR>To call hers exquisite, in question more:
<BR>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
<BR>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
<BR>He that is strucken blind cannot forget
<BR>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
<BR>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
<BR>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
<BR>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
<BR>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

<BR>This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,

<BR>Such as I love; and you, among the store,
<BR>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
<BR>At my poor house look to behold this night
<BR>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
<BR>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
<BR>When well-apparell'd April on the heel
<BR>Of limping winter treads, even such delight
<BR>Among fresh female buds shall you this night
<BR>Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,

<tr valign=top><td>LADY CAPULET
<td>A fortnight and odd days.


<tr valign=top><td>Nurse
<td>Even or odd, of all days in the year,

<BR>Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
<BR>Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
<BR>She was too good for me: but, as I said,
<BR>On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
<BR>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
<BR>'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
<BR>And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
<BR>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
<BR>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
<BR>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
<BR>My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
<BR>Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
<BR>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
<BR>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
<BR>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
<BR>Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
<BR>To bid me trudge:
<BR>And since that time it is eleven years;
<BR>For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
<BR>She could have run and waddled all about;
<BR>For even the day before, she broke her brow:
<BR>And then my husband--God be with his soul!
<BR>A' was a merry man--took up the child:
<BR>'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
<BR>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
<BR>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
<BR>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
<BR>To see, now, how a jest shall come about!

<BR>'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
<BR>Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;

<BR>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
<BR>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
<BR>The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride

<BR>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;

<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.


<tr valign=top><td>MERCUTIO
<td>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
<BR>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
<BR>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
<BR>On the fore-finger of an alderman,
<BR>Drawn with a team of little atomies
<BR>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
<BR>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
<BR>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
<BR>The traces of the smallest spider's web,
<BR>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
<BR>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
<BR>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
<BR>Not so big as a round little worm
<BR>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
<BR>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
<BR>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
<BR>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
<BR>And in this state she gallops night by night
<BR>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
<BR>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
<BR>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
<BR>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
<BR>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
<BR>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
<BR>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
<BR>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
<BR>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
<BR>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
<BR>Then dreams, he of another benefice:
<BR>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
<BR>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
<BR>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
<BR>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
<BR>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
<BR>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
<BR>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
<BR>That plats the manes of horses in the night,
<BR>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
<BR>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
<BR>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
<BR>That presses them and learns them first to bear,
<BR>Making them women of good carriage:
<BR>This is she--


<tr valign=top><td>ROMEO
<td>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
<BR>Thou talk'st of nothing.


<tr valign=top><td>MERCUTIO
<td>True, I talk of dreams,
<BR>Which are the children of an idle brain,
<BR>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
<BR>Which is as thin of substance as the air
<BR>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
<BR>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
<BR>And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
<BR>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

<BR>With this night's revels and expire the term
<BR>Of a despised life closed in my breast
<BR>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

<BR>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
<BR>Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,

<BR>Being held a foe, he may not have access

<BR>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;

<BR>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
<BR>But to the earth some special good doth give,
<BR>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use

<BR>O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
<BR>O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
<BR>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
<BR>O cousin, cousin!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?


<tr valign=top><td>BENVOLIO
<td>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
<BR>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
<BR>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
<BR>Your high displeasure: all this uttered
<BR>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
<BR>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
<BR>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
<BR>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
<BR>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
<BR>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
<BR>Cold death aside, and with the other sends
<BR>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
<BR>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
<BR>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
<BR>his tongue,
<BR>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
<BR>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
<BR>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
<BR>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
<BR>But by and by comes back to Romeo,
<BR>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
<BR>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
<BR>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
<BR>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
<BR>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY CAPULET
<td>He is a kinsman to the Montague;
<BR>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
<BR>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
<BR>And all those twenty could but kill one life.
<BR>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
<BR>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

<BR>To stop the inundation of her tears;

<BR>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;

<BR>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,

<BR>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
<BR>And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
<BR>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
<BR>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
<BR>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
<BR>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
<BR>Then, as the manner of our country is,
<BR>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
<BR>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
<BR>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
<BR>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
<BR>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
<BR>And hither shall he come: and he and I
<BR>Will watch thy waking, and that very night
<BR>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
<BR>And this shall free thee from this present shame;
<BR>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,

<BR>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
<BR>What said my man, when my betossed soul
<BR>Did not attend him as we rode? I think
<BR>He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
<BR>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
<BR>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
<BR>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
<BR>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
<BR>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
<BR>A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
<BR>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
<BR>This vault a feasting presence full of light.
<BR>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Laying PARIS in the tomb]

<BR>A lightning before death: O, how may I

<BR>Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
<BR>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
<BR>Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
<BR>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,

<BR>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
<BR>O, what more favour can I do to thee,
<BR>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
<BR>To sunder his that was thine enemy?
<BR>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
<BR>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
<BR>That unsubstantial death is amorous,
<BR>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
<BR>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
<BR>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
<BR>And never from this palace of dim night
<BR>Depart again: here, here will I remain
<BR>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
<BR>Will I set up my everlasting rest,
<BR>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
<BR>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
<BR>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
<BR>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
<BR>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
<BR>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!

<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR LAURENCE
<td>I will be brief, for my short date of breath
<BR>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
<BR>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
<BR>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
<BR>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
<BR>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
<BR>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
<BR>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
<BR>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
<BR>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
<BR>To County Paris: then comes she to me,
<BR>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
<BR>To rid her from this second marriage,
<BR>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
<BR>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
<BR>A sleeping potion; which so took effect
<BR>As I intended, for it wrought on her
<BR>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
<BR>That he should hither come as this dire night,
<BR>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
<BR>Being the time the potion's force should cease.
<BR>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
<BR>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
<BR>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
<BR>At the prefixed hour of her waking,
<BR>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
<BR>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
<BR>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
<BR>But when I came, some minute ere the time
<BR>Of her awaking, here untimely lay
<BR>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
<BR>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
<BR>And bear this work of heaven with patience:
<BR>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
<BR>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
<BR>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
<BR>All this I know; and to the marriage
<BR>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
<BR>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
<BR>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
<BR>Unto the rigour of severest law.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>We still have known thee for a holy man.
<BR>Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?


<tr valign=top><td>BALTHASAR
<td>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
<BR>And then in post he came from Mantua
<BR>To this same place, to this same monument.
<BR>This letter he early bid me give his father,
<BR>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
<BR>I departed not and left him there.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>Give me the letter; I will look on it.
<BR>Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
<BR>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
<BR>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
<BR>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
<BR>And by and by my master drew on him;
<BR>And then I ran away to call the watch.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>This letter doth make good the friar's words,
<BR>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
<BR>And here he writes that he did buy a poison
<BR>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
<BR>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
<BR>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
<BR>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
<BR>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
<BR>And I for winking at your discords too
<BR>Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.


<tr valign=top><td>CAPULET
<td>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
<BR>This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
<BR>Can I demand.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTAGUE
<td>But I can give thee more:
<BR>For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
<BR>That while Verona by that name is known,
<BR>There shall no figure at such rate be set
<BR>As that of true and faithful Juliet.


<tr valign=top><td>CAPULET
<td>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
<BR>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE
<td>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
<BR>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
<BR>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
<BR>Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
<BR>For never was a story of more woe
<BR>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
