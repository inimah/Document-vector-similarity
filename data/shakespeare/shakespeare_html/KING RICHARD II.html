<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other
<BR>Nobles and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
<BR>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
<BR>Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
<BR>Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
<BR>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
<BR>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>I have, my liege.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
<BR>If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
<BR>Or worthily, as a good subject should,
<BR>On some known ground of treachery in him?


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>As near as I could sift him on that argument,
<BR>On some apparent danger seen in him
<BR>Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Then call them to our presence; face to face,
<BR>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
<BR>The accuser and the accused freely speak:
<BR>High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
<BR>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY]


<tr valign=top><td>HENRY BOLINGBROKE
<td>Many years of happy days befal
<BR>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>Each day still better other's happiness;
<BR>Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
<BR>Add an immortal title to your crown!


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
<BR>As well appeareth by the cause you come;
<BR>Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
<BR>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
<BR>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?


<tr valign=top><td>HENRY BOLINGBROKE
<td>First, heaven be the record to my speech!
<BR>In the devotion of a subject's love,
<BR>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
<BR>And free from other misbegotten hate,
<BR>Come I appellant to this princely presence.
<BR>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
<BR>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
<BR>My body shall make good upon this earth,
<BR>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
<BR>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
<BR>Too good to be so and too bad to live,
<BR>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
<BR>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
<BR>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
<BR>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
<BR>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
<BR>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
<BR>'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
<BR>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
<BR>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
<BR>The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
<BR>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
<BR>As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
<BR>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
<BR>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
<BR>Which else would post until it had return'd
<BR>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
<BR>Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
<BR>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
<BR>I do defy him, and I spit at him;
<BR>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
<BR>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
<BR>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
<BR>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
<BR>Or any other ground inhabitable,
<BR>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
<BR>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
<BR>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.


<tr valign=top><td>HENRY BOLINGBROKE
<td>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
<BR>Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
<BR>And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
<BR>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
<BR>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
<BR>As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
<BR>By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
<BR>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
<BR>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>I take it up; and by that sword I swear
<BR>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
<BR>I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
<BR>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
<BR>And when I mount, alive may I not light,
<BR>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
<BR>It must be great that can inherit us
<BR>So much as of a thought of ill in him.


<tr valign=top><td>HENRY BOLINGBROKE
<td>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
<BR>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
<BR>In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
<BR>The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
<BR>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
<BR>Besides I say and will in battle prove,
<BR>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
<BR>That ever was survey'd by English eye,
<BR>That all the treasons for these eighteen years
<BR>Complotted and contrived in this land
<BR>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
<BR>Further I say and further will maintain
<BR>Upon his bad life to make all this good,
<BR>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
<BR>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
<BR>And consequently, like a traitor coward,
<BR>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
<BR>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
<BR>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
<BR>To me for justice and rough chastisement;
<BR>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
<BR>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>How high a pitch his resolution soars!
<BR>Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>O, let my sovereign turn away his face
<BR>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
<BR>Till I have told this slander of his blood,
<BR>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
<BR>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
<BR>As he is but my father's brother's son,
<BR>Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
<BR>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
<BR>Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
<BR>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
<BR>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
<BR>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
<BR>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
<BR>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
<BR>Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
<BR>The other part reserved I by consent,
<BR>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
<BR>Upon remainder of a dear account,
<BR>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
<BR>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
<BR>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
<BR>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
<BR>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
<BR>The honourable father to my foe
<BR>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
<BR>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
<BR>But ere I last received the sacrament
<BR>I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
<BR>Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
<BR>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
<BR>It issues from the rancour of a villain,
<BR>A recreant and most degenerate traitor
<BR>Which in myself I boldly will defend;
<BR>And interchangeably hurl down my gage
<BR>Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
<BR>To prove myself a loyal gentleman
<BR>Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
<BR>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
<BR>Your highness to assign our trial day.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
<BR>Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
<BR>This we prescribe, though no physician;
<BR>Deep malice makes too deep incision;
<BR>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
<BR>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
<BR>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
<BR>We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>To be a make-peace shall become my age:
<BR>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>And, Norfolk, throw down his.


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>When, Harry, when?
<BR>Obedience bids I should not bid again.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
<BR>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
<BR>The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
<BR>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
<BR>To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
<BR>I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
<BR>Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
<BR>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
<BR>Which breathed this poison.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Rage must be withstood:
<BR>Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.


<tr valign=top><td>THOMAS MOWBRAY
<td>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
<BR>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
<BR>The purest treasure mortal times afford
<BR>Is spotless reputation: that away,
<BR>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
<BR>A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
<BR>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
<BR>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
<BR>Take honour from me, and my life is done:
<BR>Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
<BR>In that I live and for that will I die.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.


<tr valign=top><td>HENRY BOLINGBROKE
<td>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
<BR>Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
<BR>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
<BR>Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
<BR>Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
<BR>Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
<BR>The slavish motive of recanting fear,
<BR>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
<BR>Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit JOHN OF GAUNT]


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>We were not born to sue, but to command;
<BR>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
<BR>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
<BR>At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
<BR>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
<BR>The swelling difference of your settled hate:
<BR>Since we can not atone you, we shall see
<BR>Justice design the victor's chivalry.
<BR>Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
<BR>Be ready to direct these home alarms.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS]


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
<BR>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
<BR>To stir against the butchers of his life!
<BR>But since correction lieth in those hands
<BR>Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
<BR>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
<BR>Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
<BR>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.


<tr valign=top><td>DUCHESS
<td>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
<BR>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
<BR>Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
<BR>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
<BR>Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
<BR>Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
<BR>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
<BR>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
<BR>One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
<BR>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
<BR>Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
<BR>Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
<BR>By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
<BR>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
<BR>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
<BR>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
<BR>Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
<BR>In some large measure to thy father's death,
<BR>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
<BR>Who was the model of thy father's life.
<BR>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
<BR>In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
<BR>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
<BR>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
<BR>That which in mean men we intitle patience
<BR>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
<BR>What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
<BR>The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
<BR>His deputy anointed in His sight,
<BR>Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
<BR>Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
<BR>An angry arm against His minister.


<tr valign=top><td>DUCHESS
<td>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>To God, the widow's champion and defence.


<tr valign=top><td>DUCHESS
<td>Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
<BR>Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
<BR>Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
<BR>O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
<BR>That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
<BR>Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
<BR>Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
<BR>They may break his foaming courser's back,
<BR>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
<BR>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
<BR>Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
<BR>With her companion grief must end her life.


<tr valign=top><td>JOHN OF GAUNT
<td>Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
<BR>As much good stay with thee as go with me!


<tr valign=top><td>DUCHESS
<td>Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
<BR>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
<BR>I take my leave before I have begun,
<BR>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
<BR>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
<BR>Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
<BR>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
<BR>I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
<BR>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
<BR>Alack, and what shall good old York there see
<BR>But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
<BR>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
<BR>And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
<BR>Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
<BR>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
<BR>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:

<BR>That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
<BR>Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours

<BR>Observed his courtship to the common people;
<BR>How he did seem to dive into their hearts
<BR>With humble and familiar courtesy,
<BR>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
<BR>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
<BR>And patient underbearing of his fortune,

<BR>If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
<BR>Call in the letters patent that he hath
<BR>By his attorneys-general to sue
<BR>His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,

<BR>You would have thought the very windows spake,
<BR>So many greedy looks of young and old
<BR>Through casements darted their desiring eyes

<BR>With painted imagery had said at once
<BR>'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
<BR>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
<BR>Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
<BR>Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'

<BR>Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
<BR>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
<BR>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
<BR>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
<BR>His face still combating with tears and smiles,
<BR>The badges of his grief and patience,
<BR>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
<BR>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
<BR>And barbarism itself have pitied him.

<td>Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
<BR>Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
<BR>And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
<BR>'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
<BR>I never long'd to hear a word till now;
<BR>Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
<BR>The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
<BR>No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE OF YORK

<tr valign=top><td>DUCHESS OF YORK

<BR>Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
<BR>That set'st the word itself against the word!
<BR>Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
<BR>The chopping French we do not understand.
<BR>Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
<BR>Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
<BR>That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
<BR>Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KING RICHARD]


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>I have been studying how I may compare
<BR>This prison where I live unto the world:
<BR>And for because the world is populous
<BR>And here is not a creature but myself,
<BR>I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
<BR>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
<BR>My soul the father; and these two beget
<BR>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
<BR>And these same thoughts people this little world,
<BR>In humours like the people of this world,
<BR>For no thought is contented. The better sort,
<BR>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
<BR>With scruples and do set the word itself
<BR>Against the word:
<BR>As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
<BR>'It is as hard to come as for a camel
<BR>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
<BR>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
<BR>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
<BR>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
<BR>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
<BR>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
<BR>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
<BR>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
<BR>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
<BR>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
<BR>That many have and others must sit there;
<BR>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
<BR>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
<BR>Of such as have before endured the like.
<BR>Thus play I in one person many people,
<BR>And none contented: sometimes am I king;
<BR>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
<BR>And so I am: then crushing penury
<BR>Persuades me I was better when a king;
<BR>Then am I king'd again: and by and by
<BR>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
<BR>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
<BR>Nor I nor any man that but man is
<BR>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
<BR>With being nothing. Music do I hear?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Music]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
<BR>When time is broke and no proportion kept!
<BR>So is it in the music of men's lives.
<BR>And here have I the daintiness of ear
<BR>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
<BR>But for the concord of my state and time
<BR>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
<BR>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
<BR>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
<BR>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
<BR>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
<BR>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
<BR>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
<BR>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
<BR>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
<BR>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
<BR>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
<BR>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
<BR>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
<BR>This music mads me; let it sound no more;
<BR>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
<BR>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
<BR>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
<BR>For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
<BR>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

<BR>Where no man never comes but that sad dog
<BR>That brings me food to make misfortune live?


<tr valign=top><td>Groom
<td>I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
<BR>When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
<BR>With much ado at length have gotten leave
<BR>To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
<BR>O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
<BR>In London streets, that coronation-day,
<BR>When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
<BR>That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
<BR>That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
<BR>How went he under him?


<tr valign=top><td>Groom
<td>So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.


<tr valign=top><td>KING RICHARD II
<td>So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
<BR>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
<BR>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
<BR>Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
<BR>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
<BR>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
<BR>Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
<BR>Since thou, created to be awed by man,
<BR>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
<BR>And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
<BR>Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.
