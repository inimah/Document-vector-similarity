<BR>SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON]


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?


<tr valign=top><td>CHATILLON
<td>Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
<BR>In my behavior to the majesty,
<BR>The borrow'd majesty, of England here.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.


<tr valign=top><td>CHATILLON
<td>Philip of France, in right and true behalf
<BR>Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
<BR>Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
<BR>To this fair island and the territories,
<BR>To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
<BR>Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
<BR>Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
<BR>And put these same into young Arthur's hand,
<BR>Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>What follows if we disallow of this?


<tr valign=top><td>CHATILLON
<td>The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
<BR>To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
<BR>Controlment for controlment: so answer France.


<tr valign=top><td>CHATILLON
<td>Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
<BR>The farthest limit of my embassy.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
<BR>Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
<BR>For ere thou canst report I will be there,
<BR>The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
<BR>So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
<BR>And sullen presage of your own decay.
<BR>An honourable conduct let him have:
<BR>Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE]


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>What now, my son! have I not ever said
<BR>How that ambitious Constance would not cease
<BR>Till she had kindled France and all the world,
<BR>Upon the right and party of her son?
<BR>This might have been prevented and made whole
<BR>With very easy arguments of love,
<BR>Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
<BR>With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Our strong possession and our right for us.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>Your strong possession much more than your right,
<BR>Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
<BR>So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
<BR>Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Sheriff]


<tr valign=top><td>ESSEX
<td>My liege, here is the strangest controversy
<BR>Come from country to be judged by you,
<BR>That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Let them approach.
<BR>Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
<BR>This expedition's charge.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD]

<tr valign=top><td><td>What men are you?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
<BR>Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
<BR>As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
<BR>A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
<BR>Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>What art thou?


<tr valign=top><td>ROBERT
<td>The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
<BR>You came not of one mother then, it seems.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
<BR>That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
<BR>But for the certain knowledge of that truth
<BR>I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
<BR>Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
<BR>And wound her honour with this diffidence.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
<BR>That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
<BR>The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
<BR>At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
<BR>Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
<BR>Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>I know not why, except to get the land.
<BR>But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
<BR>But whether I be as true begot or no,
<BR>That still I lay upon my mother's head,
<BR>But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
<BR>Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
<BR>Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
<BR>If old sir Robert did beget us both
<BR>And were our father and this son like him,
<BR>O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
<BR>I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
<BR>The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
<BR>Do you not read some tokens of my son
<BR>In the large composition of this man?


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Mine eye hath well examined his parts
<BR>And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
<BR>What doth move you to claim your brother's land?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
<BR>With half that face would he have all my land:
<BR>A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!


<tr valign=top><td>ROBERT
<td>My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
<BR>Your brother did employ my father much,--


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
<BR>Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.


<tr valign=top><td>ROBERT
<td>And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
<BR>To Germany, there with the emperor
<BR>To treat of high affairs touching that time.
<BR>The advantage of his absence took the king
<BR>And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
<BR>Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
<BR>But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
<BR>Between my father and my mother lay,
<BR>As I have heard my father speak himself,
<BR>When this same lusty gentleman was got.
<BR>Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
<BR>His lands to me, and took it on his death
<BR>That this my mother's son was none of his;
<BR>And if he were, he came into the world
<BR>Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
<BR>Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
<BR>My father's land, as was my father's will.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
<BR>Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
<BR>And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
<BR>Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
<BR>That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
<BR>Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
<BR>Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
<BR>In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
<BR>This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
<BR>In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,
<BR>My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
<BR>Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
<BR>My mother's son did get your father's heir;
<BR>Your father's heir must have your father's land.


<tr valign=top><td>ROBERT
<td>Shall then my father's will be of no force
<BR>To dispossess that child which is not his?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
<BR>Than was his will to get me, as I think.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
<BR>And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
<BR>Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
<BR>Lord of thy presence and no land beside?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
<BR>And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;
<BR>And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
<BR>My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
<BR>That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
<BR>Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
<BR>And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
<BR>Would I might never stir from off this place,
<BR>I would give it every foot to have this face;
<BR>I would not be sir Nob in any case.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
<BR>Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
<BR>I am a soldier and now bound to France.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
<BR>Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
<BR>Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
<BR>Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>Nay, I would have you go before me thither.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Our country manners give our betters way.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>What is thy name?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
<BR>Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:
<BR>Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
<BR>Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
<BR>My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
<BR>Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
<BR>When I was got, sir Robert was away!


<tr valign=top><td>QUEEN ELINOR
<td>The very spirit of Plantagenet!
<BR>I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
<BR>Something about, a little from the right,
<BR>In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
<BR>Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
<BR>And have is have, however men do catch:
<BR>Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
<BR>And I am I, howe'er I was begot.


<tr valign=top><td>KING JOHN
<td>Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
<BR>A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
<BR>Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
<BR>For France, for France, for it is more than need.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
<BR>For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but BASTARD]

<tr valign=top><td><td>A foot of honour better than I was;
<BR>But many a many foot of land the worse.
<BR>Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
<BR>'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
<BR>And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
<BR>For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
<BR>'Tis too respective and too sociable
<BR>For your conversion. Now your traveller,
<BR>He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
<BR>And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
<BR>Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
<BR>My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
<BR>Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
<BR>'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
<BR>And then comes answer like an Absey book:
<BR>'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
<BR>At your employment; at your service, sir;'
<BR>'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
<BR>And so, ere answer knows what question would,
<BR>Saving in dialogue of compliment,
<BR>And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
<BR>The Pyrenean and the river Po,
<BR>It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
<BR>But this is worshipful society
<BR>And fits the mounting spirit like myself,
<BR>For he is but a bastard to the time
<BR>That doth not smack of observation;
<BR>And so am I, whether I smack or no;
<BR>And not alone in habit and device,
<BR>Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
<BR>But from the inward motion to deliver
<BR>Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
<BR>Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
<BR>Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
<BR>For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
<BR>But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
<BR>What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
<BR>That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY]

<tr valign=top><td><td>O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!

<tr valign=top><td>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE

<tr valign=top><td>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE

<BR>He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD

<tr valign=top><td>GURNEY
<td>Good leave, good Philip.

<td>Philip! sparrow: James,
<BR>There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit GURNEY]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:

<BR>Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
<BR>Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
<BR>Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
<BR>We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
<BR>To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
<BR>Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
<td>Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
<BR>That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
<BR>What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
<BR>What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
<BR>But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
<BR>I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
<BR>Legitimation, name and all is gone:
<BR>Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
<BR>Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?


<tr valign=top><td>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
<td>Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>As faithfully as I deny the devil.


<tr valign=top><td>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
<td>King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
<BR>By long and vehement suit I was seduced
<BR>To make room for him in my husband's bed:
<BR>Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
<BR>Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
<BR>Which was so strongly urged past my defence.


<tr valign=top><td>BASTARD
<td>Now, by this light, were I to get again,
<BR>Madam, I would not wish a better father.
<BR>Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
<BR>And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
<BR>Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
<BR>Subjected tribute to commanding love,
<BR>Against whose fury and unmatched force
<BR>The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
<BR>Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
<BR>He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
<BR>May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
<BR>With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
<BR>Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
<BR>When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
<BR>Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
<BR>And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
<BR>If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:

<BR>And why rail I on this Commodity?
<BR>But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
<BR>Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
<BR>When his fair angels would salute my palm;
<BR>But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
<BR>Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.

<BR>With all religious strength of sacred vows;
<BR>The latest breath that gave the sound of words
<BR>Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
<BR>Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
<BR>And even before this truce, but new before,
<BR>No longer than we well could wash our hands
<BR>To clap this royal bargain up of peace,

<BR>So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
<BR>Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
<BR>Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
<BR>Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
<BR>As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
<BR>Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
<BR>Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
<BR>And make a riot on the gentle brow
<BR>Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
<BR>My reverend father, let it not be so!
<BR>Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
<BR>Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest

<BR>France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,

<td>So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
<BR>And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
<BR>Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
<BR>First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
<BR>That is, to be the champion of our church!
<BR>What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
<BR>And may not be performed by thyself,
<BR>For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
<BR>Is not amiss when it is truly done,
<BR>And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
<BR>The truth is then most done not doing it:
<BR>The better act of purposes mistook
<BR>Is to mistake again; though indirect,
<BR>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
<BR>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
<BR>Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
<BR>It is religion that doth make vows kept;
<BR>But thou hast sworn against religion,
<BR>By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
<BR>And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
<BR>Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
<BR>To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
<BR>Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
<BR>But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
<BR>And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
<BR>Therefore thy later vows against thy first
<BR>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
<BR>And better conquest never canst thou make
<BR>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
<BR>Against these giddy loose suggestions:
<BR>Upon which better part our prayers come in,
<BR>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
<BR>The peril of our curses light on thee

<BR>And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
<BR>Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,

<BR>Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
<BR>Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes

<BR>Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
<BR>Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
<BR>Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,

<BR>And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
<BR>That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
<BR>If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
<BR>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
<BR>To him that did but yesterday suspire,
<BR>There was not such a gracious creature born.

<BR>And chase the native beauty from his cheek
<BR>And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
<BR>As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,

<BR>I shall not know him: therefore never, never

<tr valign=top><td>CARDINAL PANDULPH

<BR>Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
<BR>Out of the path which shall directly lead
<BR>Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
<BR>John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
<BR>That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
<BR>The misplaced John should entertain an hour,

<BR>A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
<BR>Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;

<BR>That none so small advantage shall step forth
<BR>To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;
<BR>No natural exhalation in the sky,
<BR>No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
<BR>No common wind, no customed event,
<BR>But they will pluck away his natural cause
<BR>And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
<BR>Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
<BR>Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.


<tr valign=top><td>LEWIS
<td>May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
<BR>But hold himself safe in his prisonment.

<BR>Of all his people shall revolt from him
<BR>And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
<BR>And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
<BR>Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
<BR>Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:

<BR>Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,

<td>This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,

<tr valign=top><td>SALISBURY

<BR>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
<BR>To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
<BR>Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.


<tr valign=top><td>PEMBROKE

<BR>Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,

<tr valign=top><td>PEMBROKE
<td>When workmen strive to do better than well,

<BR>Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
<BR>I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;

<BR>And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
<BR>But thou didst understand me by my signs
<BR>And didst in signs again parley with sin;

<BR>Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
<BR>This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
<BR>Hostility and civil tumult reigns
<BR>Between my conscience and my cousin's death.


<tr valign=top><td>HUBERT

<BR>Within this bosom never enter'd yet
<BR>The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
<BR>And you have slander'd nature in my form,
<BR>Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
<BR>Is yet the cover of a fairer mind

<BR>To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
<BR>I am not glad that such a sore of time
<BR>Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
<BR>And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
<BR>By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
<BR>That I must draw this metal from my side
<BR>To be a widow-maker! O, and there
<BR>Where honourable rescue and defence
<BR>Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
<BR>But such is the infection of the time,
<BR>That, for the health and physic of our right,
<BR>We cannot deal but with the very hand
<BR>Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
<BR>And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
<BR>That we, the sons and children of this isle,
<BR>Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
<BR>Wherein we step after a stranger march
<BR>Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
<BR>Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
<BR>Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
<BR>To grace the gentry of a land remote,
<BR>And follow unacquainted colours here?
<BR>What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
<BR>That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
<BR>Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
<BR>And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;
<BR>Where these two Christian armies might combine
<BR>The blood of malice in a vein of league,
<BR>And not to spend it so unneighbourly!

<BR>And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
<BR>Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
<BR>O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
<BR>Between compulsion and a brave respect!
<BR>Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
<BR>That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
<BR>My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
<BR>Being an ordinary inundation;
<BR>But this effusion of such manly drops,
<BR>This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
<BR>Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
<BR>Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
<BR>Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
<BR>Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
<BR>And with a great heart heave away the storm:
<BR>Commend these waters to those baby eyes
<BR>That never saw the giant world enraged;
<BR>Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
<BR>Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
<BR>Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
<BR>Into the purse of rich prosperity
<BR>As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
<BR>That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
