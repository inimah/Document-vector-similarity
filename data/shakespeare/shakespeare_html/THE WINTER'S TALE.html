<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
<BR>the like occasion whereon my services are now on
<BR>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
<BR>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
<BR>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
<BR>justified in our loves; for indeed--


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Beseech you,--


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
<BR>we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
<BR>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
<BR>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
<BR>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
<BR>us.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
<BR>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
<BR>They were trained together in their childhoods; and
<BR>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
<BR>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
<BR>more mature dignities and royal necessities made
<BR>separation of their society, their encounters,
<BR>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
<BR>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
<BR>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
<BR>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
<BR>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
<BR>winds. The heavens continue their loves!


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>I think there is not in the world either malice or
<BR>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
<BR>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
<BR>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
<BR>into my note.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
<BR>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
<BR>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
<BR>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
<BR>see him a man.


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>Would they else be content to die?


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
<BR>desire to live.


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHIDAMUS
<td>If the king had no son, they would desire to live
<BR>on crutches till he had one.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,
<BR>POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Nine changes of the watery star hath been
<BR>The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
<BR>Without a burthen: time as long again
<BR>Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
<BR>And yet we should, for perpetuity,
<BR>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
<BR>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
<BR>With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
<BR>That go before it.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Stay your thanks a while;
<BR>And pay them when you part.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Sir, that's to-morrow.
<BR>I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
<BR>Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
<BR>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
<BR>'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
<BR>To tire your royalty.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>We are tougher, brother,
<BR>Than you can put us to't.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>No longer stay.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>One seven-night longer.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Very sooth, to-morrow.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>We'll part the time between's then; and in that
<BR>I'll no gainsaying.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Press me not, beseech you, so.
<BR>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
<BR>So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
<BR>Were there necessity in your request, although
<BR>'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
<BR>Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
<BR>Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
<BR>To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
<BR>Farewell, our brother.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Tongue-tied, our queen?
<BR>speak you.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
<BR>You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
<BR>Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
<BR>All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
<BR>The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
<BR>He's beat from his best ward.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Well said, Hermione.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
<BR>But let him say so then, and let him go;
<BR>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
<BR>We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
<BR>Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
<BR>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
<BR>You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
<BR>To let him there a month behind the gest
<BR>Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
<BR>I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
<BR>What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>No, madam.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>Nay, but you will?


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>I may not, verily.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>Verily!
<BR>You put me off with limber vows; but I,
<BR>Though you would seek to unsphere the
<BR>stars with oaths,
<BR>Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
<BR>You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
<BR>As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
<BR>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
<BR>Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
<BR>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
<BR>My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
<BR>One of them you shall be.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Your guest, then, madam:
<BR>To be your prisoner should import offending;
<BR>Which is for me less easy to commit
<BR>Than you to punish.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>Not your gaoler, then,
<BR>But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
<BR>Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
<BR>You were pretty lordings then?


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>We were, fair queen,
<BR>Two lads that thought there was no more behind
<BR>But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
<BR>And to be boy eternal.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>Was not my lord
<BR>The verier wag o' the two?


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
<BR>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
<BR>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
<BR>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
<BR>That any did. Had we pursued that life,
<BR>And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
<BR>With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
<BR>Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
<BR>Hereditary ours.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>By this we gather
<BR>You have tripp'd since.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>O my most sacred lady!
<BR>Temptations have since then been born to's; for
<BR>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
<BR>Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
<BR>Of my young play-fellow.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>Grace to boot!
<BR>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
<BR>Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
<BR>The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
<BR>If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
<BR>You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
<BR>With any but with us.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Is he won yet?


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>He'll stay my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>At my request he would not.
<BR>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
<BR>To better purpose.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>Never?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Never, but once.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
<BR>I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
<BR>As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
<BR>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
<BR>Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
<BR>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
<BR>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
<BR>My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
<BR>What was my first? it has an elder sister,
<BR>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
<BR>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
<BR>Nay, let me have't; I long.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Why, that was when
<BR>Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
<BR>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
<BR>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
<BR>'I am yours for ever.'


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>'Tis grace indeed.
<BR>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
<BR>The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
<BR>The other for some while a friend.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!
<BR>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
<BR>I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
<BR>But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
<BR>May a free face put on, derive a liberty
<BR>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
<BR>And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
<BR>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
<BR>As now they are, and making practised smiles,
<BR>As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
<BR>The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
<BR>My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
<BR>Art thou my boy?


<tr valign=top><td>MAMILLIUS
<td>Ay, my good lord.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>I' fecks!
<BR>Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
<BR>smutch'd thy nose?
<BR>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
<BR>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
<BR>And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
<BR>Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
<BR>Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
<BR>Art thou my calf?


<tr valign=top><td>MAMILLIUS
<td>Yes, if you will, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
<BR>To be full like me: yet they say we are
<BR>Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
<BR>That will say anything but were they false
<BR>As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
<BR>As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
<BR>No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
<BR>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
<BR>Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
<BR>Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
<BR>Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
<BR>Thou dost make possible things not so held,
<BR>Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
<BR>With what's unreal thou coactive art,
<BR>And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
<BR>Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
<BR>And that beyond commission, and I find it,
<BR>And that to the infection of my brains
<BR>And hardening of my brows.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>What means Sicilia?


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>He something seems unsettled.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>How, my lord!
<BR>What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
<BR>Are you moved, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>No, in good earnest.
<BR>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
<BR>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
<BR>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
<BR>Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
<BR>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
<BR>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
<BR>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
<BR>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
<BR>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
<BR>This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
<BR>Will you take eggs for money?


<tr valign=top><td>MAMILLIUS
<td>No, my lord, I'll fight.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
<BR>Are you so fond of your young prince as we
<BR>Do seem to be of ours?


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>If at home, sir,
<BR>He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
<BR>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
<BR>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
<BR>He makes a July's day short as December,
<BR>And with his varying childness cures in me
<BR>Thoughts that would thick my blood.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>So stands this squire
<BR>Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
<BR>And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
<BR>How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
<BR>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
<BR>Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
<BR>Apparent to my heart.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>If you would seek us,
<BR>We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
<BR>Be you beneath the sky.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I am angling now,
<BR>Though you perceive me not how I give line.
<BR>Go to, go to!
<BR>How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
<BR>And arms her with the boldness of a wife
<BR>To her allowing husband!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Gone already!
<BR>Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
<BR>ears a fork'd one!
<BR>Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
<BR>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
<BR>Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
<BR>Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
<BR>There have been,
<BR>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
<BR>And many a man there is, even at this present,
<BR>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
<BR>That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
<BR>And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
<BR>Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
<BR>Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
<BR>As mine, against their will. Should all despair
<BR>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
<BR>Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
<BR>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
<BR>Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
<BR>From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
<BR>No barricado for a belly; know't;
<BR>It will let in and out the enemy
<BR>With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
<BR>Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!


<tr valign=top><td>MAMILLIUS
<td>I am like you, they say.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Ay, my good lord.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit MAMILLIUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
<BR>When you cast out, it still came home.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Didst note it?


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>He would not stay at your petitions: made
<BR>His business more material.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Didst perceive it?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside]

<tr valign=top><td><td>They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
<BR>'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
<BR>When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
<BR>That he did stay?


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>At the good queen's entreaty.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
<BR>But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
<BR>By any understanding pate but thine?
<BR>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
<BR>More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
<BR>But of the finer natures? by some severals
<BR>Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
<BR>Perchance are to this business purblind? say.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Business, my lord! I think most understand
<BR>Bohemia stays here longer.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Ha!


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Stays here longer.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Ay, but why?


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
<BR>Of our most gracious mistress.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Satisfy!
<BR>The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
<BR>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
<BR>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
<BR>My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
<BR>Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
<BR>Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
<BR>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
<BR>In that which seems so.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>Be it forbid, my lord!


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
<BR>If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
<BR>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
<BR>From course required; or else thou must be counted
<BR>A servant grafted in my serious trust
<BR>And therein negligent; or else a fool
<BR>That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
<BR>And takest it all for jest.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>My gracious lord,
<BR>I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
<BR>In every one of these no man is free,
<BR>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
<BR>Among the infinite doings of the world,
<BR>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
<BR>If ever I were wilful-negligent,
<BR>It was my folly; if industriously
<BR>I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
<BR>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
<BR>To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
<BR>Where of the execution did cry out
<BR>Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
<BR>Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
<BR>Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
<BR>Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
<BR>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
<BR>By its own visage: if I then deny it,
<BR>'Tis none of mine.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
<BR>But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
<BR>Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
<BR>For to a vision so apparent rumour
<BR>Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
<BR>Resides not in that man that does not think,--
<BR>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
<BR>Or else be impudently negative,
<BR>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
<BR>My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
<BR>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
<BR>Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>I would not be a stander-by to hear
<BR>My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
<BR>My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
<BR>You never spoke what did become you less
<BR>Than this; which to reiterate were sin
<BR>As deep as that, though true.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES

<BR>That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
<BR>That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
<BR>And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,

<BR>Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,

<BR>When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,

<BR>To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
<BR>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,

<BR>In storm perpetual, could not move the gods

<tr valign=top><td>FLORIZEL
<td>These your unusual weeds to each part of you
<BR>Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
<BR>Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
<BR>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
<BR>And you the queen on't.


<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA
<td>Sir, my gracious lord,
<BR>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
<BR>O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
<BR>The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
<BR>With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
<BR>Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
<BR>In every mess have folly and the feeders
<BR>Digest it with a custom, I should blush
<BR>To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
<BR>To show myself a glass.


<tr valign=top><td>FLORIZEL
<td>I bless the time
<BR>When my good falcon made her flight across
<BR>Thy father's ground.


<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA
<td>Now Jove afford you cause!
<BR>To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
<BR>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
<BR>To think your father, by some accident,
<BR>Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
<BR>How would he look, to see his work so noble
<BR>Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
<BR>Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
<BR>The sternness of his presence?


<tr valign=top><td>FLORIZEL
<td>Apprehend
<BR>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
<BR>Humbling their deities to love, have taken
<BR>The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
<BR>Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
<BR>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
<BR>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
<BR>As I seem now. Their transformations
<BR>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
<BR>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
<BR>Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
<BR>Burn hotter than my faith.


<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA
<td>O, but, sir,
<BR>Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
<BR>Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
<BR>One of these two must be necessities,
<BR>Which then will speak, that you must
<BR>change this purpose,
<BR>Or I my life.


<tr valign=top><td>FLORIZEL
<td>Thou dearest Perdita,
<BR>With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
<BR>The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
<BR>Or not my father's. For I cannot be
<BR>Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
<BR>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
<BR>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
<BR>Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
<BR>That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
<BR>Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
<BR>Of celebration of that nuptial which
<BR>We two have sworn shall come.

<BR>At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
<BR>On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
<BR>With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
<BR>She would to each one sip. You are retired,

<BR>To get slips of them.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Wherefore, gentle maiden,

<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA

<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Say there be;
<BR>Yet nature is made better by no mean
<BR>But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
<BR>Which you say adds to nature, is an art
<BR>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
<BR>A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
<BR>And make conceive a bark of baser kind
<BR>By bud of nobler race: this is an art
<BR>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
<BR>The art itself is nature.


<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA
<td>So it is.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,

<BR>Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;

<BR>Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
<BR>That wear upon your virgin branches yet
<BR>Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
<BR>For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
<BR>From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
<BR>That come before the swallow dares, and take
<BR>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
<BR>But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
<BR>Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
<BR>That die unmarried, ere they can behold
<BR>Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
<BR>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and

<BR>Does change my disposition.


<tr valign=top><td>FLORIZEL

<BR>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
<BR>I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
<BR>I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
<BR>Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
<BR>To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
<BR>A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do

<BR>till he had both tune and words; which so drew the

<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>After I have done what I promised?


<tr valign=top><td>Shepherd
<td>Ay, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
<BR>one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
<BR>he'll be made an example.


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
<BR>our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
<BR>daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
<BR>will give you as much as this old man does when the
<BR>business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
<BR>pawn till it be brought you.


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS

<BR>courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
<BR>to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
<BR>that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
<BR>these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
<BR>think it fit to shore them again and that the
<BR>complaint they have to the king concerns him
<BR>nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far

<tr valign=top><td>CLEOMENES
<td>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
<BR>A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
<BR>Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
<BR>More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
<BR>Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
<BR>With them forgive yourself.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Whilst I remember
<BR>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
<BR>My blemishes in them, and so still think of
<BR>The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
<BR>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
<BR>Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
<BR>Bred his hopes out of.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>True, too true, my lord:
<BR>If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
<BR>Or from the all that are took something good,
<BR>To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
<BR>Would be unparallel'd.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>I think so. Kill'd!
<BR>She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
<BR>Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
<BR>Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
<BR>Say so but seldom.


<tr valign=top><td>CLEOMENES
<td>Not at all, good lady:
<BR>You might have spoken a thousand things that would
<BR>Have done the time more benefit and graced
<BR>Your kindness better.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>You are one of those
<BR>Would have him wed again.


<tr valign=top><td>DION
<td>If you would not so,
<BR>You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
<BR>Of his most sovereign name; consider little
<BR>What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
<BR>May drop upon his kingdom and devour
<BR>Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
<BR>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
<BR>What holier than, for royalty's repair,
<BR>For present comfort and for future good,
<BR>To bless the bed of majesty again
<BR>With a sweet fellow to't?


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>There is none worthy,
<BR>Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
<BR>Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
<BR>For has not the divine Apollo said,
<BR>Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
<BR>That King Leontes shall not have an heir
<BR>Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
<BR>Is all as monstrous to our human reason
<BR>As my Antigonus to break his grave
<BR>And come again to me; who, on my life,
<BR>Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
<BR>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
<BR>Oppose against their wills.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To LEONTES]

<BR>Who hast the memory of Hermione,
<BR>I know, in honour, O, that ever I

<BR>Have taken treasure from her lips--


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>And left them
<BR>More rich for what they yielded.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Thou speak'st truth.
<BR>No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
<BR>And better used, would make her sainted spirit
<BR>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
<BR>Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
<BR>And begin, 'Why to me?'


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>Had she such power,
<BR>She had just cause.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>She had; and would incense me
<BR>To murder her I married.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>I should so.
<BR>Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
<BR>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
<BR>You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
<BR>Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
<BR>Should be 'Remember mine.'


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Stars, stars,
<BR>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;

<BR>Never to marry but by my free leave?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

<BR>Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
<BR>No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
<BR>To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young

<tr valign=top><td>Gentleman

<BR>The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his

<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>O my brother,

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman]


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
<BR>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
<BR>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
<BR>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
<BR>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>I would most gladly know the issue of it.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
<BR>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
<BR>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
<BR>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
<BR>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
<BR>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
<BR>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
<BR>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
<BR>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
<BR>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
<BR>extremity of the one, it must needs be.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter another Gentleman]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
<BR>The news, Rogero?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
<BR>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
<BR>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
<BR>cannot be able to express it.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a third Gentleman]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
<BR>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
<BR>which is called true is so like an old tale, that
<BR>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
<BR>found his heir?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
<BR>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
<BR>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
<BR>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
<BR>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
<BR>know to be his character, the majesty of the
<BR>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
<BR>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
<BR>and many other evidences proclaim her with all
<BR>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
<BR>the meeting of the two kings?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>No.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
<BR>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
<BR>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
<BR>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
<BR>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
<BR>holding up of hands, with countenances of such
<BR>distraction that they were to be known by garment,
<BR>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
<BR>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
<BR>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
<BR>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
<BR>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
<BR>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
<BR>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
<BR>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
<BR>another encounter, which lames report to follow it
<BR>and undoes description to do it.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
<BR>hence the child?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
<BR>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
<BR>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
<BR>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
<BR>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
<BR>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>What became of his bark and his followers?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
<BR>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
<BR>instruments which aided to expose the child were
<BR>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
<BR>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
<BR>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
<BR>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
<BR>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
<BR>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
<BR>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
<BR>of losing.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
<BR>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
<BR>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
<BR>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
<BR>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
<BR>confessed and lamented by the king, how
<BR>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
<BR>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
<BR>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
<BR>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
<BR>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
<BR>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Are they returned to the court?


<tr valign=top><td>Third Gentleman
<td>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
<BR>which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
<BR>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
<BR>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
<BR>eternity and could put breath into his work, would
<BR>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
<BR>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
<BR>they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
<BR>answer: thither with all greediness of affection
<BR>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Gentleman
<td>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
<BR>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
<BR>since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
<BR>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
<BR>the rejoicing?


<tr valign=top><td>First Gentleman
<td>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
<BR>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
<BR>our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
<BR>Let's along.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Gentlemen]


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
<BR>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
<BR>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
<BR>them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
<BR>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
<BR>so he then took her to be, who began to be much
<BR>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
<BR>weather continuing, this mystery remained
<BR>undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
<BR>been the finder out of this secret, it would not
<BR>have relished among my other discredits.

<tr valign=top><td>Shepherd
<td>And so have I, boy.


<tr valign=top><td>Clown

<BR>called me brother; and then the two kings called my
<BR>father brother; and then the prince my brother and
<BR>the princess my sister called my father father; and
<BR>so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like

<td>Thou wilt amend thy life?


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>Ay, an it like your good worship.


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
<BR>art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.


<tr valign=top><td>Shepherd
<td>You may say it, but not swear it.


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
<BR>franklins say it, I'll swear it.


<tr valign=top><td>Shepherd
<td>How if it be false, son?


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
<BR>it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
<BR>the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
<BR>that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
<BR>tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
<BR>drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
<BR>be a tall fellow of thy hands.


<tr valign=top><td>AUTOLYCUS
<td>I will prove so, sir, to my power.


<tr valign=top><td>Clown
<td>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
<BR>wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
<BR>being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
<BR>and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
<BR>queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
<BR>good masters.

<HR><H3><A NAME="xref021">Scene III	A chapel in PAULINA'S house.</A></H3>


<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,
<BR>CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
<BR>That I have had of thee!


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>What, sovereign sir,
<BR>I did not well I meant well. All my services
<BR>You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
<BR>With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
<BR>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
<BR>It is a surplus of your grace, which never
<BR>My life may last to answer.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>O Paulina,
<BR>We honour you with trouble: but we came
<BR>To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
<BR>Have we pass'd through, not without much content
<BR>In many singularities; but we saw not
<BR>That which my daughter came to look upon,
<BR>The statue of her mother.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>As she lived peerless,
<BR>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
<BR>Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
<BR>Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
<BR>Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
<BR>To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
<BR>Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE
<BR>standing like a statue]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I like your silence, it the more shows off
<BR>Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
<BR>Comes it not something near?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Her natural posture!
<BR>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
<BR>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
<BR>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
<BR>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
<BR>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
<BR>So aged as this seems.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>O, not by much.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>So much the more our carver's excellence;
<BR>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
<BR>As she lived now.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>As now she might have done,
<BR>So much to my good comfort, as it is
<BR>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
<BR>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
<BR>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
<BR>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
<BR>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
<BR>There's magic in thy majesty, which has
<BR>My evils conjured to remembrance and
<BR>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
<BR>Standing like stone with thee.


<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA
<td>And give me leave,
<BR>And do not say 'tis superstition, that
<BR>I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
<BR>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
<BR>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>O, patience!
<BR>The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
<BR>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
<BR>So many summers dry; scarce any joy
<BR>Did ever so long live; no sorrow
<BR>But kill'd itself much sooner.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Dear my brother,
<BR>Let him that was the cause of this have power
<BR>To take off so much grief from you as he
<BR>Will piece up in himself.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>Indeed, my lord,
<BR>If I had thought the sight of my poor image
<BR>Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
<BR>I'ld not have show'd it.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Do not draw the curtain.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
<BR>May think anon it moves.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Let be, let be.
<BR>Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
<BR>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
<BR>Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
<BR>Did verily bear blood?


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Masterly done:
<BR>The very life seems warm upon her lip.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
<BR>As we are mock'd with art.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>I'll draw the curtain:
<BR>My lord's almost so far transported that
<BR>He'll think anon it lives.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>O sweet Paulina,
<BR>Make me to think so twenty years together!
<BR>No settled senses of the world can match
<BR>The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
<BR>I could afflict you farther.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Do, Paulina;
<BR>For this affliction has a taste as sweet
<BR>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
<BR>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
<BR>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
<BR>For I will kiss her.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>Good my lord, forbear:
<BR>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
<BR>You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
<BR>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>No, not these twenty years.


<tr valign=top><td>PERDITA
<td>So long could I
<BR>Stand by, a looker on.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>Either forbear,
<BR>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
<BR>For more amazement. If you can behold it,
<BR>I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
<BR>And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
<BR>Which I protest against--I am assisted
<BR>By wicked powers.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>What you can make her do,
<BR>I am content to look on: what to speak,
<BR>I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
<BR>To make her speak as move.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>It is required
<BR>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
<BR>On: those that think it is unlawful business
<BR>I am about, let them depart.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>Proceed:
<BR>No foot shall stir.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>Music, awake her; strike!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Music]

<tr valign=top><td><td>'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
<BR>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
<BR>I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
<BR>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
<BR>Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[HERMIONE comes down]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Start not; her actions shall be holy as
<BR>You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
<BR>Until you see her die again; for then
<BR>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
<BR>When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
<BR>Is she become the suitor?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>O, she's warm!
<BR>If this be magic, let it be an art
<BR>Lawful as eating.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>She embraces him.


<tr valign=top><td>CAMILLO
<td>She hangs about his neck:
<BR>If she pertain to life let her speak too.


<tr valign=top><td>POLIXENES
<td>Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
<BR>Or how stolen from the dead.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>That she is living,
<BR>Were it but told you, should be hooted at
<BR>Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
<BR>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
<BR>Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
<BR>And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
<BR>Our Perdita is found.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIONE
<td>You gods, look down
<BR>And from your sacred vials pour your graces
<BR>Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
<BR>Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
<BR>Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
<BR>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
<BR>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
<BR>Myself to see the issue.


<tr valign=top><td>PAULINA
<td>There's time enough for that;
<BR>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
<BR>Your joys with like relation. Go together,
<BR>You precious winners all; your exultation
<BR>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
<BR>Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
<BR>My mate, that's never to be found again,
<BR>Lament till I am lost.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONTES
<td>O, peace, Paulina!
<BR>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
<BR>As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
<BR>And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
<BR>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
<BR>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
<BR>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
<BR>For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
<BR>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
<BR>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
<BR>Is richly noted and here justified
<BR>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
<BR>What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
<BR>That e'er I put between your holy looks
<BR>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
<BR>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
<BR>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
<BR>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
<BR>Each one demand an answer to his part
<BR>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
<BR>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
