<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
<BR>and LAFEU, all in black]


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
<BR>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
<BR>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
<BR>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
<BR>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
<BR>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
<BR>than lack it where there is such abundance.


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
<BR>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
<BR>finds no other advantage in the process but only the
<BR>losing of hope by time.


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
<BR>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
<BR>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
<BR>far, would have made nature immortal, and death
<BR>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
<BR>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
<BR>the death of the king's disease.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>How called you the man you speak of, madam?


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
<BR>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
<BR>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
<BR>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
<BR>could be set up against mortality.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>A fistula, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>I heard not of it before.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
<BR>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
<BR>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
<BR>her education promises; her dispositions she
<BR>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
<BR>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
<BR>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
<BR>traitors too; in her they are the better for their
<BR>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
<BR>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
<BR>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
<BR>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
<BR>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
<BR>a sorrow than have it.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
<BR>excessive grief the enemy to the living.


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
<BR>makes it soon mortal.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>How understand we that?


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
<BR>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
<BR>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
<BR>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
<BR>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
<BR>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
<BR>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
<BR>But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
<BR>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
<BR>Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
<BR>'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
<BR>Advise him.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>He cannot want the best
<BR>That shall attend his love.


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS
<td>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in
<BR>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
<BR>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.


<tr valign=top><td>LAFEU
<td>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
<BR>your father.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU]


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>O, were that all! I think not on my father;
<BR>And these great tears grace his remembrance more
<BR>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
<BR>I have forgot him: my imagination
<BR>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
<BR>I am undone: there is no living, none,
<BR>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
<BR>That I should love a bright particular star
<BR>And think to wed it, he is so above me:
<BR>In his bright radiance and collateral light
<BR>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
<BR>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
<BR>The hind that would be mated by the lion
<BR>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
<BR>To see him every hour; to sit and draw
<BR>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
<BR>In our heart's table; heart too capable
<BR>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
<BR>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
<BR>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PAROLLES]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside]

<tr valign=top><td><td>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
<BR>And yet I know him a notorious liar,
<BR>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
<BR>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
<BR>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
<BR>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
<BR>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Save you, fair queen!


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>And you, monarch!


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>No.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>And no.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Are you meditating on virginity?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
<BR>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
<BR>may we barricado it against him?


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Keep him out.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
<BR>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
<BR>warlike resistance.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
<BR>undermine you and blow you up.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
<BR>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
<BR>virgins might blow up men?


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
<BR>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
<BR>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
<BR>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
<BR>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
<BR>increase and there was never virgin got till
<BR>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
<BR>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
<BR>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
<BR>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
<BR>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
<BR>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
<BR>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
<BR>virginity murders itself and should be buried in
<BR>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
<BR>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
<BR>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
<BR>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
<BR>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
<BR>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
<BR>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
<BR>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
<BR>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
<BR>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
<BR>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
<BR>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
<BR>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
<BR>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
<BR>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
<BR>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
<BR>now. Your date is better in your pie and your
<BR>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
<BR>your old virginity, is like one of our French
<BR>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
<BR>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
<BR>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>Not my virginity yet [         ]
<BR>There shall your master have a thousand loves,
<BR>A mother and a mistress and a friend,
<BR>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
<BR>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
<BR>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
<BR>His humble ambition, proud humility,
<BR>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
<BR>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
<BR>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
<BR>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
<BR>I know not what he shall. God send him well!
<BR>The court's a learning place, and he is one--


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>What one, i' faith?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>That I wish well. 'Tis pity--


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>What's pity?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>That wishing well had not a body in't,
<BR>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
<BR>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
<BR>Might with effects of them follow our friends,
<BR>And show what we alone must think, which never
<BR>Return us thanks.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Page]

<td>Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
<BR>will think of thee at court.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Under Mars, I.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>I especially think, under Mars.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Why under Mars?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
<BR>be born under Mars.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>When he was predominant.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>Why think you so?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>You go so much backward when you fight.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>That's for advantage.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
<BR>but the composition that your valour and fear makes
<BR>in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.


<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES
<td>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
<BR>acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
<BR>which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
<BR>thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
<BR>counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
<BR>thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
<BR>thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
<BR>thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
<BR>none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
<BR>and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
<BR>Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
<BR>Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
<BR>Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
<BR>What power is it which mounts my love so high,
<BR>That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
<BR>The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
<BR>To join like likes and kiss like native things.
<BR>Impossible be strange attempts to those
<BR>That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
<BR>What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
<BR>So show her merit, that did miss her love?
<BR>The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
<BR>But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
<BR>Young Bertram.


<tr valign=top><td>KING
<td>Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
<BR>Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
<BR>Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
<BR>Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>My thanks and duty are your majesty's.


<tr valign=top><td>KING
<td>I would I had that corporal soundness now,
<BR>As when thy father and myself in friendship
<BR>First tried our soldiership! He did look far
<BR>Into the service of the time and was
<BR>Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
<BR>But on us both did haggish age steal on
<BR>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
<BR>To talk of your good father. In his youth
<BR>He had the wit which I can well observe
<BR>To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
<BR>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
<BR>Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
<BR>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
<BR>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
<BR>His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
<BR>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
<BR>Exception bid him speak, and at this time
<BR>His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
<BR>He used as creatures of another place
<BR>And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
<BR>Making them proud of his humility,
<BR>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
<BR>Might be a copy to these younger times;
<BR>Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
<BR>But goers backward.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>His good remembrance, sir,
<BR>Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
<BR>So in approof lives not his epitaph
<BR>As in your royal speech.


<tr valign=top><td>KING
<td>Would I were with him! He would always say--
<BR>Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
<BR>He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
<BR>To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
<BR>This his good melancholy oft began,
<BR>On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
<BR>When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
<BR>'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
<BR>Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
<BR>All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
<BR>Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
<BR>Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
<BR>I after him do after him wish too,
<BR>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
<BR>I quickly were dissolved from my hive,

<BR>Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put

<BR>This she delivered in the most bitter touch of

<BR>Yet never know how that desert should be.
<BR>I know I love in vain, strive against hope;

<BR>I still pour in the waters of my love
<BR>And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,

<BR>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
<BR>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
<BR>Let not your hate encounter with my love
<BR>For loving where you do: but if yourself,
<BR>Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
<BR>Did ever in so true a flame of liking
<BR>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
<BR>Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
<BR>To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
<BR>But lend and give where she is sure to lose;

<BR>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
<BR>And manifest experience had collected
<BR>For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
<BR>In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,

<td>But think you, Helen,
<BR>If you should tender your supposed aid,
<BR>He would receive it? he and his physicians
<BR>Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
<BR>They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
<BR>A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
<BR>Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
<BR>The danger to itself?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>There's something in't,
<BR>More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
<BR>Of his profession, that his good receipt
<BR>Shall for my legacy be sanctified
<BR>By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
<BR>But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
<BR>The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
<BR>By such a day and hour.


<tr valign=top><td>COUNTESS

<tr valign=top><td>HELENA

<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>Do you think I am so far deceived in him?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
<BR>without any malice, but to speak of him as my
<BR>kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
<BR>endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
<BR>of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
<BR>entertainment.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
<BR>his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
<BR>great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM

<tr valign=top><td>First Lord

<BR>which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
<BR>surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
<BR>knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
<BR>him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
<BR>is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
<BR>we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
<BR>present at his examination: if he do not, for the
<BR>promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
<BR>base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
<BR>intelligence in his power against you, and that with
<BR>the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
<BR>trust my judgment in any thing.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
<BR>he says he has a stratagem for't: when your

<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES

<BR>There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
<BR>horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord

<tr valign=top><td>PAROLLES

<td>Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
<BR>think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
<BR>instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
<BR>be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
<BR>grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
<BR>speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.

<td>O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
<BR>I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
<BR>And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
<BR>'When from my finger you can get this ring
<BR>And are by me with child,' &amp;c. This is done:
<BR>Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?


<tr valign=top><td>BERTRAM
<td>If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
<BR>I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

<td>If it appear not plain and prove untrue,

<tr valign=top><td><td>Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
<BR>I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:

<BR>Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
<BR>For I can guess that by thy honest aid
<BR>Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
<BR>Of that and all the progress, more or less,
<BR>Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
<BR>All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
<BR>The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

<tr valign=top><td>KING
<td>The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
<BR>All is well ended, if this suit be won,
<BR>That you express content; which we will pay,
<BR>With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
<BR>Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
<BR>Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
