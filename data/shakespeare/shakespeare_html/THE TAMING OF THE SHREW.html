<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in

<BR>Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?


<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold

<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>I know my remedy; I must go fetch the

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
<BR>by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
<BR>and kindly.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Falls asleep]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train]


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
<BR>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
<BR>And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
<BR>Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
<BR>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
<BR>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.


<tr valign=top><td>First Huntsman
<td>Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
<BR>He cried upon it at the merest loss
<BR>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
<BR>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
<BR>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
<BR>But sup them well and look unto them all:
<BR>To-morrow I intend to hunt again.


<tr valign=top><td>First Huntsman
<td>I will, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Huntsman
<td>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
<BR>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
<BR>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
<BR>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
<BR>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
<BR>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
<BR>A most delicious banquet by his bed,
<BR>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
<BR>Would not the beggar then forget himself?


<tr valign=top><td>First Huntsman
<td>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Huntsman
<td>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
<BR>Then take him up and manage well the jest:
<BR>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
<BR>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
<BR>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
<BR>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
<BR>Procure me music ready when he wakes,
<BR>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
<BR>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
<BR>And with a low submissive reverence
<BR>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
<BR>Let one attend him with a silver basin
<BR>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
<BR>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
<BR>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
<BR>Some one be ready with a costly suit
<BR>And ask him what apparel he will wear;
<BR>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
<BR>And that his lady mourns at his disease:
<BR>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
<BR>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
<BR>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
<BR>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
<BR>It will be pastime passing excellent,
<BR>If it be husbanded with modesty.


<tr valign=top><td>First Huntsman
<td>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
<BR>As he shall think by our true diligence
<BR>He is no less than what we say he is.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Take him up gently and to bed with him;
<BR>And each one to his office when he wakes.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Servingman]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
<BR>Travelling some journey, to repose him here.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Servingman]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now! who is it?


<tr valign=top><td>Servant
<td>An't please your honour, players
<BR>That offer service to your lordship.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Bid them come near.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Players]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Now, fellows, you are welcome.


<tr valign=top><td>Players
<td>We thank your honour.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?


<tr valign=top><td>A Player
<td>So please your lordship to accept our duty.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
<BR>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
<BR>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
<BR>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
<BR>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.


<tr valign=top><td>A Player
<td>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
<BR>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
<BR>The rather for I have some sport in hand
<BR>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
<BR>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
<BR>But I am doubtful of your modesties;
<BR>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
<BR>For yet his honour never heard a play--
<BR>You break into some merry passion
<BR>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
<BR>If you should smile he grows impatient.


<tr valign=top><td>A Player
<td>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
<BR>Were he the veriest antic in the world.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
<BR>And give them friendly welcome every one:
<BR>Let them want nothing that my house affords.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit one with the Players]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
<BR>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
<BR>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
<BR>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
<BR>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
<BR>He bear himself with honourable action,
<BR>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
<BR>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
<BR>Such duty to the drunkard let him do
<BR>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
<BR>And say 'What is't your honour will command,
<BR>Wherein your lady and your humble wife
<BR>May show her duty and make known her love?'
<BR>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
<BR>And with declining head into his bosom,
<BR>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
<BR>To see her noble lord restored to health,
<BR>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
<BR>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
<BR>And if the boy have not a woman's gift
<BR>To rain a shower of commanded tears,
<BR>An onion will do well for such a shift,
<BR>Which in a napkin being close convey'd
<BR>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
<BR>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
<BR>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit a Servingman]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
<BR>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
<BR>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
<BR>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
<BR>When they do homage to this simple peasant.
<BR>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
<BR>May well abate the over-merry spleen
<BR>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

<tr valign=top><td>Third Servant

<tr valign=top><td>SLY

<BR>'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
<BR>you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
<BR>beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
<BR>have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
<BR>than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
<BR>sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
<BR>toes look through the over-leather.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
<BR>O, that a mighty man of such descent,
<BR>Of such possessions and so high esteem,
<BR>Should be infused with so foul a spirit!


<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
<BR>Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
<BR>pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
<BR>bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
<BR>Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
<BR>she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
<BR>on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
<BR>lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
<BR>bestraught: here's--


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servant
<td>O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!


<tr valign=top><td>Second Servant
<td>O, this is it that makes your servants droop!


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
<BR>As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
<BR>O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
<BR>Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
<BR>And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
<BR>Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
<BR>Each in his office ready at thy beck.
<BR>Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Music]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
<BR>Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
<BR>Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
<BR>On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
<BR>Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
<BR>Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
<BR>Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
<BR>Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
<BR>Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
<BR>Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
<BR>And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.


<tr valign=top><td>First Servant
<td>Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
<BR>As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Servant
<td>Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
<BR>Adonis painted by a running brook,
<BR>And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
<BR>Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
<BR>Even as the waving sedges play with wind.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
<BR>And how she was beguiled and surprised,
<BR>As lively painted as the deed was done.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servant
<td>Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
<BR>Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
<BR>And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
<BR>So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord
<td>Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
<BR>Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
<BR>Than any woman in this waning age.


<tr valign=top><td>First Servant
<td>And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
<BR>Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
<BR>She was the fairest creature in the world;
<BR>And yet she is inferior to none.


<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
<BR>Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
<BR>I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
<BR>I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
<BR>Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
<BR>And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
<BR>Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
<BR>And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Servant
<td>Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
<BR>O, how we joy to see your wit restored!

<BR>These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
<BR>Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.


<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
<BR>But did I never speak of all that time?


<tr valign=top><td>First Servant
<td>O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
<BR>For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
<BR>Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
<BR>And rail upon the hostess of the house;
<BR>And say you would present her at the leet,
<BR>Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
<BR>Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.


<tr valign=top><td>SLY
<td>Ay, the woman's maid of the house.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Servant
<td>Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
<BR>Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
<BR>As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
<BR>And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
<BR>And twenty more such names and men as these
<BR>Which never were nor no man ever saw.

<BR>The pleasant garden of great Italy;
<BR>And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
<BR>With his good will and thy good company,
<BR>My trusty servant, well approved in all,
<BR>Here let us breathe and haply institute
<BR>A course of learning and ingenious studies.
<BR>Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
<BR>Gave me my being and my father first,
<BR>A merchant of great traffic through the world,
<BR>Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
<BR>Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
<BR>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
<BR>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
<BR>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
<BR>Virtue and that part of philosophy
<BR>Will I apply that treats of happiness
<BR>By virtue specially to be achieved.
<BR>Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
<BR>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves

<BR>Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
<BR>Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
<BR>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
<BR>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have

<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
<BR>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,

<BR>When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
<BR>I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
<BR>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
<BR>Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
<BR>That till the father rid his hands of her,
<BR>Master, your love must live a maid at home;
<BR>And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
<BR>Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO

<BR>Visit his countrymen and banquet them?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO

<BR>We have not yet been seen in any house,
<BR>Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
<BR>For man or master; then it follows thus;
<BR>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
<BR>Keep house and port and servants as I should:
<BR>I will some other be, some Florentine,
<BR>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
<BR>'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once

<BR>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,

<BR>For so your father charged me at our parting,

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Verona, for a while I take my leave,
<BR>To see my friends in Padua, but of all
<BR>My best beloved and approved friend,
<BR>Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
<BR>Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO

<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
<BR>I should knock you here, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
<BR>And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
<BR>you first,
<BR>And then I know after who comes by the worst.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Will it not be?
<BR>Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
<BR>I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

<td>How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
<BR>and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
<BR>'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
<BR>mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
<BR>this quarrel.


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
<BR>if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
<BR>service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
<BR>him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
<BR>use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
<BR>two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
<BR>well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,

<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO

<BR>words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
<BR>knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
<BR>now with, 'knocking at the gate'?


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
<BR>Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
<BR>Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
<BR>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
<BR>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
<BR>To seek their fortunes farther than at home
<BR>Where small experience grows. But in a few,
<BR>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
<BR>Antonio, my father, is deceased;
<BR>And I have thrust myself into this maze,
<BR>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
<BR>Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
<BR>And so am come abroad to see the world.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
<BR>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
<BR>Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
<BR>And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
<BR>And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
<BR>And I'll not wish thee to her.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
<BR>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
<BR>One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
<BR>As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
<BR>Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
<BR>As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
<BR>As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
<BR>She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
<BR>Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
<BR>As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
<BR>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
<BR>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
<BR>mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
<BR>a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
<BR>a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
<BR>as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
<BR>so money comes withal.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
<BR>I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
<BR>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
<BR>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
<BR>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
<BR>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
<BR>Is that she is intolerable curst
<BR>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
<BR>That, were my state far worser than it is,
<BR>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
<BR>Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
<BR>For I will board her, though she chide as loud
<BR>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Her father is Baptista Minola,
<BR>An affable and courteous gentleman:
<BR>Her name is Katharina Minola,
<BR>Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>I know her father, though I know not her;
<BR>And he knew my deceased father well.
<BR>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
<BR>And therefore let me be thus bold with you
<BR>To give you over at this first encounter,
<BR>Unless you will accompany me thither.


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
<BR>O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
<BR>would think scolding would do little good upon him:
<BR>she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
<BR>why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
<BR>his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
<BR>stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
<BR>her face and so disfigure her with it that she
<BR>shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
<BR>You know him not, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
<BR>For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
<BR>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
<BR>His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
<BR>And her withholds from me and other more,
<BR>Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
<BR>Supposing it a thing impossible,
<BR>For those defects I have before rehearsed,
<BR>That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
<BR>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
<BR>That none shall have access unto Bianca
<BR>Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>Katharina the curst!
<BR>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
<BR>And offer me disguised in sober robes
<BR>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
<BR>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
<BR>That so I may, by this device, at least
<BR>Have leave and leisure to make love to her
<BR>And unsuspected court her by herself.

<BR>You understand me: over and beside
<BR>Signior Baptista's liberality,
<BR>I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
<BR>And let me have them very well perfumed
<BR>For she is sweeter than perfume itself
<BR>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
<BR>As for my patron, stand you so assured,
<BR>As firmly as yourself were still in place:
<BR>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
<BR>Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO

<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO

<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
<BR>Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
<BR>I promised to inquire carefully
<BR>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
<BR>And by good fortune I have lighted well
<BR>On this young man, for learning and behavior
<BR>Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
<BR>And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
<BR>Hath promised me to help me to another,

<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO

<BR>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
<BR>Upon agreement from us to his liking,
<BR>Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,

<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>So said, so done, is well.

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO

<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Why came I hither but to that intent?
<BR>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
<BR>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
<BR>Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
<BR>Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
<BR>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
<BR>And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
<BR>Have I not in a pitched battle heard
<BR>Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
<BR>And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
<BR>That gives not half so great a blow to hear
<BR>As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?

<BR>Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>And if I be, sir, is it any offence?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>No; if without more words you will get you hence.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
<BR>For me as for you?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>But so is not she.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>For what reason, I beseech you?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>For this reason, if you'll know,
<BR>That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
<BR>Do me this right; hear me with patience.
<BR>Baptista is a noble gentleman,
<BR>To whom my father is not all unknown;
<BR>And were his daughter fairer than she is,
<BR>She may more suitors have and me for one.
<BR>Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
<BR>Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
<BR>And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
<BR>Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
<BR>Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
<BR>The one as famous for a scolding tongue
<BR>As is the other for beauteous modesty.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
<BR>And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
<BR>The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
<BR>Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
<BR>And will not promise her to any man
<BR>Until the elder sister first be wed:
<BR>The younger then is free and not before.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>If it be so, sir, that you are the man
<BR>Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
<BR>And if you break the ice and do this feat,
<BR>Achieve the elder, set the younger free
<BR>For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
<BR>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
<BR>And since you do profess to be a suitor,
<BR>You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
<BR>To whom we all rest generally beholding.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
<BR>Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
<BR>And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
<BR>And do as adversaries do in law,
<BR>Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
<BR>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
<BR>And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
<BR>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
<BR>'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
<BR>with them:'
<BR>And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
<BR>And through the instrument my pate made way;
<BR>And there I stood amazed for a while,
<BR>As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
<BR>While she did call me rascal fiddler
<BR>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
<BR>As had she studied to misuse me so.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO

<BR>I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>And I am one that love Bianca more
<BR>Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>But thine doth fry.
<BR>Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
<BR>'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
<BR>That can assure my daughter greatest dower
<BR>Shall have my Bianca's love.
<BR>Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>First, as you know, my house within the city
<BR>Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
<BR>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
<BR>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
<BR>In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
<BR>In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
<BR>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
<BR>Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
<BR>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
<BR>Pewter and brass and all things that belong
<BR>To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
<BR>I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
<BR>Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
<BR>And all things answerable to this portion.
<BR>Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
<BR>And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
<BR>If whilst I live she will be only mine.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
<BR>I am my father's heir and only son:
<BR>If I may have your daughter to my wife,
<BR>I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
<BR>Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
<BR>Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
<BR>Besides two thousand ducats by the year
<BR>Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
<BR>What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
<BR>My land amounts not to so much in all:
<BR>That she shall have; besides an argosy
<BR>That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
<BR>What, have I choked you with an argosy?


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
<BR>Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
<BR>And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
<BR>And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
<BR>And she can have no more than all I have:
<BR>If you like me, she shall have me and mine.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
<BR>By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>I must confess your offer is the best;
<BR>And, let your father make her the assurance,
<BR>She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
<BR>if you should die before him, where's her dower?


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>And may not young men die, as well as old?


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Well, gentlemen,
<BR>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
<BR>My daughter Katharina is to be married:
<BR>Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
<BR>Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
<BR>If not, Signior Gremio:
<BR>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Adieu, good neighbour.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit BAPTISTA]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Now I fear thee not:
<BR>Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
<BR>To give thee all, and in his waning age
<BR>Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
<BR>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
<BR>Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
<BR>'Tis in my head to do my master good:
<BR>I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
<BR>Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
<BR>And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
<BR>Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
<BR>A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

<BR>'pointed day.
<BR>That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
<BR>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
<BR>What will be said? what mockery will it be,
<BR>To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
<BR>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
<BR>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
<BR>To give my hand opposed against my heart
<BR>Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
<BR>Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
<BR>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
<BR>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
<BR>And, to be noted for a merry man,
<BR>He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
<BR>Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
<BR>Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
<BR>Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
<BR>And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
<BR>If it would please him come and marry her!'


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
<BR>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
<BR>Whatever fortune stays him from his word:

<td>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
<BR>jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
<BR>of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
<BR>another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
<BR>town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
<BR>with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
<BR>old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
<BR>besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
<BR>in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
<BR>with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
<BR>spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
<BR>stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
<BR>bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
<BR>near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
<BR>and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
<BR>restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
<BR>often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
<BR>six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
<BR>which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
<BR>in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Who comes with him?


<tr valign=top><td>BIONDELLO
<td>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
<BR>like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
<BR>kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
<BR>and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
<BR>fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
<BR>very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
<BR>footboy or a gentleman's lackey.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO

<BR>'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.

<BR>'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
<BR>That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
<BR>And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
<BR>The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
<BR>That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
<BR>'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>What said the wench when he rose again?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,

<BR>But after many ceremonies done,
<BR>He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
<BR>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
<BR>After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
<BR>And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
<BR>Having no other reason
<BR>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
<BR>And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
<BR>This done, he took the bride about the neck
<BR>And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
<BR>That at the parting all the church did echo:
<BR>And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
<BR>And after me, I know, the rout is coming.

<BR>before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
<BR>warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
<BR>hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
<BR>tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
<BR>belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but

<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO

<tr valign=top><td>CURTIS
<td>I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?


<tr valign=top><td>GRUMIO
<td>A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and

<BR>with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
<BR>her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
<BR>to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
<BR>that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
<BR>horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
<BR>lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,

<BR>this controversy.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They retire]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants]


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
<BR>gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
<BR>hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
<BR>am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
<BR>husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
<BR>the university.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>How now! what's the matter?


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>What, is the man lunatic?


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
<BR>habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
<BR>what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
<BR>thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
<BR>you think is his name?


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
<BR>him up ever since he was three years old, and his
<BR>name is Tranio.


<tr valign=top><td>Pedant
<td>Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
<BR>mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
<BR>on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
<BR>son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Call forth an officer.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter one with an Officer]

<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be

<BR>is the right Vincentio.


<tr valign=top><td>Pedant
<td>Swear, if thou darest.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Nay, I dare not swear it.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO

<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA

<BR>Where is Lucentio?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>Here's Lucentio,
<BR>Right son to the right Vincentio;
<BR>That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
<BR>While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>Where is that damned villain Tranio,
<BR>That faced and braved me in this matter so?


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?


<tr valign=top><td>BIANCA
<td>Cambio is changed into Lucentio.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
<BR>Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
<BR>While he did bear my countenance in the town;
<BR>And happily I have arrived at the last
<BR>Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
<BR>What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
<BR>Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent

<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA

<BR>without asking my good will?


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO

<BR>I will in, to be revenged for this villany.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO

<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA

<BR>Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet]


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
<BR>And time it is, when raging war is done,
<BR>To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
<BR>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
<BR>While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
<BR>Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
<BR>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
<BR>Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
<BR>My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
<BR>After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
<BR>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Padua affords nothing but what is kind.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>For both our sakes, I would that word were true.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>Then never trust me, if I be afeard.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
<BR>I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Roundly replied.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>Mistress, how mean you that?


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>Thus I conceive by him.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
<BR>I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
<BR>Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
<BR>And now you know my meaning,


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>A very mean meaning.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>Right, I mean you.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>And I am mean indeed, respecting you.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>To her, Kate!


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>To her, widow!


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Believe me, sir, they butt together well.


<tr valign=top><td>BIANCA
<td>Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
<BR>Would say your head and butt were head and horn.


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?


<tr valign=top><td>BIANCA
<td>Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
<BR>Have at you for a bitter jest or two!


<tr valign=top><td>BIANCA
<td>Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
<BR>And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
<BR>You are welcome all.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow]


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
<BR>This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
<BR>Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
<BR>Which runs himself and catches for his master.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>A good swift simile, but something currish.


<tr valign=top><td>TRANIO
<td>'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
<BR>'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
<BR>And, as the jest did glance away from me,
<BR>'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
<BR>I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
<BR>Let's each one send unto his wife;
<BR>And he whose wife is most obedient
<BR>To come at first when he doth send for her,
<BR>Shall win the wager which we will propose.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Content. What is the wager?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>Twenty crowns.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Twenty crowns!
<BR>I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
<BR>But twenty times so much upon my wife.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>A hundred then.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Content.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>A match! 'tis done.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Who shall begin?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>That will I.
<BR>Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.


<tr valign=top><td>BIONDELLO

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now! what news?


<tr valign=top><td>BIONDELLO
<td>Sir, my mistress sends you word
<BR>That she is busy and she cannot come.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>How! she is busy and she cannot come!
<BR>Is that an answer?


<tr valign=top><td>GREMIO
<td>Ay, and a kind one too:
<BR>Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>I hope better.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>O, ho! entreat her!
<BR>Nay, then she must needs come.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>I am afraid, sir,
<BR>Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter BIONDELLO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Now, where's my wife?


<tr valign=top><td>BIONDELLO
<td>She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
<BR>She will not come: she bids you come to her.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
<BR>Intolerable, not to be endured!
<BR>Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
<BR>Say, I command her to come to me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit GRUMIO]


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO

<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA

<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>They sit conferring by the parlor fire.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
<BR>Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
<BR>Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit KATHARINA]


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
<BR>And awful rule and right supremacy;
<BR>And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?


<tr valign=top><td>BAPTISTA
<td>Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
<BR>The wager thou hast won; and I will add
<BR>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
<BR>Another dowry to another daughter,
<BR>For she is changed, as she had never been.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Nay, I will win my wager better yet
<BR>And show more sign of her obedience,
<BR>Her new-built virtue and obedience.
<BR>See where she comes and brings your froward wives
<BR>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
<BR>Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
<BR>Till I be brought to such a silly pass!


<tr valign=top><td>BIANCA
<td>Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>I would your duty were as foolish too:
<BR>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
<BR>Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.


<tr valign=top><td>BIANCA
<td>The more fool you, for laying on my duty.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
<BR>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Come on, I say; and first begin with her.


<tr valign=top><td>Widow
<td>She shall not.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>I say she shall: and first begin with her.


<tr valign=top><td>KATHARINA
<td>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
<BR>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
<BR>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
<BR>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
<BR>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
<BR>And in no sense is meet or amiable.
<BR>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
<BR>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
<BR>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
<BR>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
<BR>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
<BR>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
<BR>And for thy maintenance commits his body
<BR>To painful labour both by sea and land,
<BR>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
<BR>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
<BR>And craves no other tribute at thy hands
<BR>But love, fair looks and true obedience;
<BR>Too little payment for so great a debt.
<BR>Such duty as the subject owes the prince
<BR>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
<BR>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
<BR>And not obedient to his honest will,
<BR>What is she but a foul contending rebel
<BR>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
<BR>I am ashamed that women are so simple
<BR>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
<BR>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
<BR>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
<BR>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
<BR>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
<BR>But that our soft conditions and our hearts
<BR>Should well agree with our external parts?
<BR>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
<BR>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
<BR>My heart as great, my reason haply more,
<BR>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
<BR>But now I see our lances are but straws,
<BR>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
<BR>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
<BR>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
<BR>And place your hands below your husband's foot:
<BR>In token of which duty, if he please,
<BR>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.


<tr valign=top><td>VINCENTIO
<td>'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>But a harsh hearing when women are froward.


<tr valign=top><td>PETRUCHIO
<td>Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
<BR>We three are married, but you two are sped.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To LUCENTIO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
<BR>And, being a winner, God give you good night!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA]


<tr valign=top><td>HORTENSIO
<td>Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCENTIO
<td>'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
