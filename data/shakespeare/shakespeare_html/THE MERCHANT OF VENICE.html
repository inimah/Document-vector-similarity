<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO]


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
<BR>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
<BR>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
<BR>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
<BR>I am to learn;
<BR>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
<BR>That I have much ado to know myself.


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
<BR>There, where your argosies with portly sail,
<BR>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
<BR>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
<BR>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
<BR>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
<BR>As they fly by them with their woven wings.


<tr valign=top><td>SALANIO
<td>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
<BR>The better part of my affections would
<BR>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
<BR>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
<BR>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
<BR>And every object that might make me fear
<BR>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
<BR>Would make me sad.


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>My wind cooling my broth
<BR>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
<BR>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
<BR>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
<BR>But I should think of shallows and of flats,
<BR>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
<BR>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
<BR>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
<BR>And see the holy edifice of stone,
<BR>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
<BR>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
<BR>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
<BR>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
<BR>And, in a word, but even now worth this,
<BR>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
<BR>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
<BR>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
<BR>But tell not me; I know, Antonio
<BR>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
<BR>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
<BR>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
<BR>Upon the fortune of this present year:
<BR>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>Why, then you are in love.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Fie, fie!


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
<BR>Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
<BR>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
<BR>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
<BR>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
<BR>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
<BR>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
<BR>And other of such vinegar aspect
<BR>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
<BR>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO]


<tr valign=top><td>SALANIO
<td>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
<BR>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
<BR>We leave you now with better company.


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
<BR>If worthier friends had not prevented me.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Your worth is very dear in my regard.
<BR>I take it, your own business calls on you
<BR>And you embrace the occasion to depart.


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>Good morrow, my good lords.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
<BR>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?


<tr valign=top><td>SALARINO
<td>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Salarino and Salanio]


<tr valign=top><td>LORENZO
<td>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
<BR>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
<BR>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>I will not fail you.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>You look not well, Signior Antonio;
<BR>You have too much respect upon the world:
<BR>They lose it that do buy it with much care:
<BR>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
<BR>A stage where every man must play a part,
<BR>And mine a sad one.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Let me play the fool:
<BR>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
<BR>And let my liver rather heat with wine
<BR>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
<BR>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
<BR>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
<BR>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
<BR>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
<BR>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
<BR>There are a sort of men whose visages
<BR>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
<BR>And do a wilful stillness entertain,
<BR>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
<BR>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
<BR>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
<BR>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
<BR>O my Antonio, I do know of these
<BR>That therefore only are reputed wise
<BR>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
<BR>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
<BR>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
<BR>I'll tell thee more of this another time:
<BR>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
<BR>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
<BR>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
<BR>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.


<tr valign=top><td>LORENZO
<td>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
<BR>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
<BR>For Gratiano never lets me speak.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Well, keep me company but two years moe,
<BR>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
<BR>In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO]


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Is that any thing now?


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
<BR>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
<BR>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
<BR>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
<BR>have them, they are not worth the search.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Well, tell me now what lady is the same
<BR>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
<BR>That you to-day promised to tell me of?


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
<BR>How much I have disabled mine estate,
<BR>By something showing a more swelling port
<BR>Than my faint means would grant continuance:
<BR>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
<BR>From such a noble rate; but my chief care
<BR>Is to come fairly off from the great debts
<BR>Wherein my time something too prodigal
<BR>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
<BR>I owe the most, in money and in love,
<BR>And from your love I have a warranty
<BR>To unburden all my plots and purposes
<BR>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
<BR>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
<BR>Within the eye of honour, be assured,
<BR>My purse, my person, my extremest means,
<BR>Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
<BR>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
<BR>The self-same way with more advised watch,
<BR>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
<BR>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
<BR>Because what follows is pure innocence.
<BR>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
<BR>That which I owe is lost; but if you please
<BR>To shoot another arrow that self way
<BR>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
<BR>As I will watch the aim, or to find both
<BR>Or bring your latter hazard back again
<BR>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>You know me well, and herein spend but time
<BR>To wind about my love with circumstance;
<BR>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
<BR>In making question of my uttermost
<BR>Than if you had made waste of all I have:
<BR>Then do but say to me what I should do
<BR>That in your knowledge may by me be done,
<BR>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>In Belmont is a lady richly left;
<BR>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
<BR>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
<BR>I did receive fair speechless messages:
<BR>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
<BR>To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
<BR>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
<BR>For the four winds blow in from every coast
<BR>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
<BR>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
<BR>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
<BR>And many Jasons come in quest of her.
<BR>O my Antonio, had I but the means
<BR>To hold a rival place with one of them,
<BR>I have a mind presages me such thrift,
<BR>That I should questionless be fortunate!


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
<BR>Neither have I money nor commodity
<BR>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
<BR>Try what my credit can in Venice do:
<BR>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
<BR>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
<BR>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
<BR>Where money is, and I no question make
<BR>To have it of my trust or for my sake.

<HR><H3><A NAME="xref004">Scene II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</A></H3>


<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
<BR>this great world.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
<BR>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
<BR>yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
<BR>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
<BR>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
<BR>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
<BR>competency lives longer.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Good sentences and well pronounced.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>They would be better, if well followed.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
<BR>do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
<BR>cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
<BR>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
<BR>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
<BR>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
<BR>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
<BR>o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
<BR>youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
<BR>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
<BR>choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
<BR>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
<BR>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
<BR>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
<BR>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
<BR>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
<BR>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
<BR>silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
<BR>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
<BR>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
<BR>warmth is there in your affection towards any of
<BR>these princely suitors that are already come?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
<BR>them, I will describe them; and, according to my
<BR>description, level at my affection.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
<BR>talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
<BR>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
<BR>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
<BR>mother played false with a smith.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>Then there is the County Palatine.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
<BR>will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
<BR>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
<BR>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
<BR>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
<BR>married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
<BR>than to either of these. God defend me from these
<BR>two!


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
<BR>In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
<BR>he! why, he hath a horse better than the
<BR>Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
<BR>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
<BR>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
<BR>fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
<BR>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
<BR>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
<BR>shall never requite him.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
<BR>of England?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
<BR>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
<BR>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
<BR>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
<BR>He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
<BR>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
<BR>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
<BR>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
<BR>behavior every where.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
<BR>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
<BR>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
<BR>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
<BR>under for another.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
<BR>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
<BR>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
<BR>when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
<BR>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
<BR>make shift to go without him.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
<BR>casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
<BR>will, if you should refuse to accept him.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
<BR>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
<BR>for if the devil be within and that temptation
<BR>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
<BR>thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
<BR>lords: they have acquainted me with their
<BR>determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
<BR>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
<BR>you may be won by some other sort than your father's
<BR>imposition depending on the caskets.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
<BR>chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
<BR>of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
<BR>are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
<BR>but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
<BR>them a fair departure.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
<BR>Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
<BR>in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
<BR>eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
<BR>thy praise.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Serving-man]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now! what news?


<tr valign=top><td>Servant
<td>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
<BR>their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
<BR>fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
<BR>prince his master will be here to-night.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
<BR>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
<BR>be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
<BR>of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
<BR>rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
<BR>Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
<BR>Whiles we shut the gates
<BR>upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO

<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK
<td>Antonio is a good man.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?


<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK
<td>Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
<BR>good man is to have you understand me that he is
<BR>sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
<BR>hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
<BR>Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
<BR>hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
<BR>other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
<BR>are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
<BR>and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
<BR>mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
<BR>winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
<BR>sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may

<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK

<BR>That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
<BR>Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
<BR>In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
<BR>And, when the work of generation was
<BR>Between these woolly breeders in the act,
<BR>The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
<BR>And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
<BR>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
<BR>Who then conceiving did in eaning time
<BR>Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
<BR>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
<BR>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

<BR>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,

<BR>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
<BR>Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
<BR>With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
<BR>'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
<BR>You spurn'd me such a day; another time
<BR>You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO

<BR>To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
<BR>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
<BR>As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
<BR>A breed for barren metal of his friend?
<BR>But lend it rather to thine enemy,
<BR>Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face

<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK

<BR>A pound of man's flesh taken from a man

<BR>To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
<BR>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
<BR>Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
<BR>For princes to come view fair Portia:
<BR>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
<BR>Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
<BR>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
<BR>As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
<BR>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.

<BR>To think so base a thought: it were too gross
<BR>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
<BR>Or shall I think in silver she's immured,

<BR>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
<BR>bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
<BR>enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
<BR>not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
<BR>dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
<BR>the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
<BR>to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
<BR>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
<BR>a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
<BR>if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
<BR>us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
<BR>revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
<BR>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
<BR>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
<BR>wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
<BR>Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
<BR>teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
<BR>will better the instruction.

<BR>Hate counsels not in such a quality.
<BR>But lest you should not understand me well,--
<BR>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
<BR>I would detain you here some month or two
<BR>Before you venture for me. I could teach you
<BR>How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
<BR>So will I never be: so may you miss me;
<BR>But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
<BR>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
<BR>They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
<BR>One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
<BR>Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
<BR>And so all yours. O, these naughty times
<BR>Put bars between the owners and their rights!
<BR>And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
<BR>Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
<BR>I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,

<td>So may the outward shows be least themselves:
<BR>The world is still deceived with ornament.
<BR>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
<BR>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
<BR>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
<BR>What damned error, but some sober brow
<BR>Will bless it and approve it with a text,

<BR>There is no vice so simple but assumes
<BR>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
<BR>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false

<BR>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
<BR>Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
<BR>And these assume but valour's excrement
<BR>To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
<BR>And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
<BR>Which therein works a miracle in nature,
<BR>Making them lightest that wear most of it:
<BR>So are those crisped snaky golden locks
<BR>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
<BR>Upon supposed fairness, often known
<BR>To be the dowry of a second head,
<BR>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
<BR>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
<BR>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
<BR>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
<BR>The seeming truth which cunning times put on
<BR>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
<BR>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
<BR>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
<BR>'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,

<BR>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
<BR>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
<BR>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
<BR>How much I was a braggart. When I told you
<BR>My state was nothing, I should then have told you
<BR>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
<BR>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
<BR>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
<BR>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
<BR>The paper as the body of my friend,
<BR>And every word in it a gaping wound,
<BR>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
<BR>Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
<BR>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
<BR>From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
<BR>And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
<BR>Of merchant-marring rocks?


<tr valign=top><td>SALERIO
<td>Not one, my lord.
<BR>Besides, it should appear, that if he had
<BR>The present money to discharge the Jew,
<BR>He would not take it. Never did I know
<BR>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
<BR>So keen and greedy to confound a man:
<BR>He plies the duke at morning and at night,
<BR>And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
<BR>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
<BR>The duke himself, and the magnificoes
<BR>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
<BR>But none can drive him from the envious plea
<BR>Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.

<BR>For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:

<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all

<BR>You have a noble and a true conceit
<BR>Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
<BR>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
<BR>But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
<BR>How true a gentleman you send relief,
<BR>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
<BR>I know you would be prouder of the work
<BR>Than customary bounty can enforce you.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>I never did repent for doing good,
<BR>Nor shall not now: for in companions
<BR>That do converse and waste the time together,
<BR>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
<BR>There must be needs a like proportion
<BR>Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
<BR>Which makes me think that this Antonio,
<BR>Being the bosom lover of my lord,
<BR>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
<BR>How little is the cost I have bestow'd
<BR>In purchasing the semblance of my soul
<BR>From out the state of hellish misery!
<BR>This comes too near the praising of myself;
<BR>Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
<BR>Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
<BR>The husbandry and manage of my house

<BR>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
<BR>That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
<BR>To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
<BR>Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
<BR>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
<BR>And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
<BR>Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
<BR>Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
<BR>But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
<BR>Forgive a moiety of the principal;
<BR>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
<BR>That have of late so huddled on his back,
<BR>Enow to press a royal merchant down
<BR>And pluck commiseration of his state
<BR>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,

<BR>To offices of tender courtesy.
<BR>We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.


<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK
<td>I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
<BR>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
<BR>To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
<BR>If you deny it, let the danger light

<BR>You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
<BR>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
<BR>Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
<BR>But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
<BR>What if my house be troubled with a rat
<BR>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
<BR>To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
<BR>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
<BR>Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
<BR>And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
<BR>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
<BR>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
<BR>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
<BR>As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
<BR>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
<BR>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
<BR>Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
<BR>Must yield to such inevitable shame
<BR>As to offend, himself being offended;
<BR>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
<BR>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
<BR>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
<BR>A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

<BR>You may as well go stand upon the beach
<BR>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
<BR>You may as well use question with the wolf
<BR>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
<BR>You may as well forbid the mountain pines
<BR>To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
<BR>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
<BR>You may as well do anything most hard,
<BR>As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--

<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
<BR>Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Is your name Shylock?


<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK
<td>Shylock is my name.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
<BR>Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
<BR>Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
<BR>You stand within his danger, do you not?


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Ay, so he says.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Do you confess the bond?


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I do.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Then must the Jew be merciful.


<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK
<td>On what compulsion must I? tell me that.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
<BR>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
<BR>Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
<BR>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
<BR>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
<BR>The throned monarch better than his crown;
<BR>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
<BR>The attribute to awe and majesty,
<BR>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
<BR>But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
<BR>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
<BR>It is an attribute to God himself;
<BR>And earthly power doth then show likest God's
<BR>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
<BR>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
<BR>That, in the course of justice, none of us
<BR>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
<BR>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
<BR>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
<BR>To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
<BR>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
<BR>Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.


<tr valign=top><td>SHYLOCK
<td>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
<BR>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Is he not able to discharge the money?


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
<BR>Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
<BR>I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
<BR>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
<BR>If this will not suffice, it must appear
<BR>That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
<BR>Wrest once the law to your authority:
<BR>To do a great right, do a little wrong,
<BR>And curb this cruel devil of his will.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>It must not be; there is no power in Venice
<BR>Can alter a decree established:
<BR>'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
<BR>And many an error by the same example

<td>Sweet Portia,
<BR>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
<BR>If you did know for whom I gave the ring
<BR>And would conceive for what I gave the ring
<BR>And how unwillingly I left the ring,
<BR>When nought would be accepted but the ring,
<BR>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>If you had known the virtue of the ring,
<BR>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
<BR>Or your own honour to contain the ring,
<BR>You would not then have parted with the ring.
<BR>What man is there so much unreasonable,
<BR>If you had pleased to have defended it
<BR>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
<BR>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
<BR>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
<BR>I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
<BR>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
<BR>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
<BR>And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
<BR>And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
<BR>Even he that did uphold the very life
<BR>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
<BR>I was enforced to send it after him;
<BR>I was beset with shame and courtesy;
<BR>My honour would not let ingratitude
<BR>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
<BR>For, by these blessed candles of the night,
<BR>Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
<BR>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
<BR>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
<BR>And that which you did swear to keep for me,
<BR>I will become as liberal as you;
<BR>I'll not deny him any thing I have,
<BR>No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
<BR>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
<BR>Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
<BR>If you do not, if I be left alone,
<BR>Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
<BR>I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
<BR>How you do leave me to mine own protection.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
<BR>For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
<BR>And, in the hearing of these many friends,
<BR>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
<BR>Wherein I see myself--


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Mark you but that!
<BR>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
<BR>In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
<BR>And there's an oath of credit.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Nay, but hear me:
<BR>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
<BR>I never more will break an oath with thee.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I once did lend my body for his wealth;
<BR>Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
<BR>Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
<BR>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
<BR>Will never more break faith advisedly.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
<BR>And bid him keep it better than the other.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
<BR>For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
<BR>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
<BR>In lieu of this last night did lie with me.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Why, this is like the mending of highways
<BR>In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
<BR>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
<BR>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
<BR>It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
<BR>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
<BR>Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
<BR>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
<BR>And even but now return'd; I have not yet
<BR>Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
<BR>And I have better news in store for you
<BR>Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
<BR>There you shall find three of your argosies
<BR>Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
<BR>You shall not know by what strange accident
<BR>I chanced on this letter.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I am dumb.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
<BR>Unless he live until he be a man.


<tr valign=top><td>BASSANIO
<td>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
<BR>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
<BR>For here I read for certain that my ships
<BR>Are safely come to road.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>How now, Lorenzo!
<BR>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.


<tr valign=top><td>NERISSA
<td>Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
<BR>There do I give to you and Jessica,
<BR>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
<BR>After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.


<tr valign=top><td>LORENZO
<td>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
<BR>Of starved people.


<tr valign=top><td>PORTIA
<td>It is almost morning,
<BR>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
<BR>Of these events at full. Let us go in;
<BR>And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
<BR>And we will answer all things faithfully.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
<BR>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
<BR>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
<BR>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
<BR>But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
<BR>That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
<BR>Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
<BR>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
