<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL
<BR>of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
<BR>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
<BR>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
<BR>To be commenced in strands afar remote.
<BR>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
<BR>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
<BR>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
<BR>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
<BR>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
<BR>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
<BR>All of one nature, of one substance bred,
<BR>Did lately meet in the intestine shock
<BR>And furious close of civil butchery
<BR>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
<BR>March all one way and be no more opposed
<BR>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
<BR>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
<BR>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
<BR>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
<BR>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
<BR>We are impressed and engaged to fight,
<BR>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
<BR>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
<BR>To chase these pagans in those holy fields
<BR>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
<BR>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
<BR>For our advantage on the bitter cross.
<BR>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
<BR>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
<BR>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
<BR>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
<BR>What yesternight our council did decree
<BR>In forwarding this dear expedience.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>My liege, this haste was hot in question,
<BR>And many limits of the charge set down
<BR>But yesternight: when all athwart there came
<BR>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
<BR>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
<BR>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
<BR>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
<BR>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
<BR>A thousand of his people butchered;
<BR>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
<BR>Such beastly shameless transformation,
<BR>By those Welshwomen done as may not be
<BR>Without much shame retold or spoken of.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>It seems then that the tidings of this broil
<BR>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
<BR>For more uneven and unwelcome news
<BR>Came from the north and thus it did import:
<BR>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
<BR>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
<BR>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
<BR>At Holmedon met,
<BR>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
<BR>As by discharge of their artillery,
<BR>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
<BR>For he that brought them, in the very heat
<BR>And pride of their contention did take horse,
<BR>Uncertain of the issue any way.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
<BR>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
<BR>Stain'd with the variation of each soil
<BR>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
<BR>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
<BR>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
<BR>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
<BR>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
<BR>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
<BR>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
<BR>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
<BR>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
<BR>And is not this an honourable spoil?
<BR>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>In faith,
<BR>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
<BR>In envy that my Lord Northumberland
<BR>Should be the father to so blest a son,
<BR>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
<BR>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
<BR>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
<BR>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
<BR>See riot and dishonour stain the brow
<BR>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
<BR>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
<BR>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
<BR>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
<BR>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
<BR>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
<BR>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
<BR>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
<BR>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
<BR>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
<BR>Malevolent to you in all aspects;
<BR>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
<BR>The crest of youth against your dignity.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>But I have sent for him to answer this;
<BR>And for this cause awhile we must neglect
<BR>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
<BR>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
<BR>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
<BR>But come yourself with speed to us again;
<BR>For more is to be said and to be done
<BR>Than out of anger can be uttered.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>I will, my liege.

<HR><H3><A NAME="6">Scene II	London. An apartment of the Prince's.</A></H3>


<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF]


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
<BR>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
<BR>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
<BR>demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
<BR>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
<BR>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
<BR>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
<BR>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
<BR>a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
<BR>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
<BR>the time of the day.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
<BR>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
<BR>by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
<BR>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
<BR>save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
<BR>thou wilt have none,--


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>What, none?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
<BR>prologue to an egg and butter.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
<BR>us that are squires of the night's body be called
<BR>thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
<BR>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
<BR>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
<BR>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
<BR>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
<BR>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
<BR>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
<BR>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
<BR>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
<BR>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
<BR>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
<BR>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
<BR>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
<BR>hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
<BR>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
<BR>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
<BR>buff jerkin?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
<BR>time and oft.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
<BR>and where it would not, I have used my credit.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
<BR>that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
<BR>wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
<BR>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
<BR>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
<BR>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>No; thou shalt.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
<BR>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
<BR>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
<BR>you.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>For obtaining of suits?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
<BR>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
<BR>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
<BR>Moor-ditch?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
<BR>the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
<BR>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
<BR>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
<BR>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
<BR>lord of the council rated me the other day in the
<BR>street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
<BR>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
<BR>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
<BR>streets, and no man regards it.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
<BR>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
<BR>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
<BR>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
<BR>should speak truly, little better than one of the
<BR>wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
<BR>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
<BR>I'll be damned for never a king's son in
<BR>Christendom.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
<BR>do not, call me villain and baffle me.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
<BR>to purse-taking.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
<BR>man to labour in his vocation.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter POINS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
<BR>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
<BR>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
<BR>most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
<BR>a true man.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Good morrow, Ned.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
<BR>what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
<BR>agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
<BR>soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
<BR>and a cold capon's leg?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
<BR>his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
<BR>proverbs: he will give the devil his due.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
<BR>o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
<BR>to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
<BR>riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
<BR>for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
<BR>Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
<BR>supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
<BR>as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
<BR>your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
<BR>at home and be hanged.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
<BR>I'll hang you for going.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>You will, chops?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Hal, wilt thou make one?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
<BR>fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
<BR>royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Why, that's well said.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I care not.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
<BR>I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
<BR>that he shall go.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
<BR>the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
<BR>move and what he hears may be believed, that the
<BR>true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
<BR>thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
<BR>countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Falstaff]


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
<BR>to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
<BR>manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
<BR>shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
<BR>yourself and I will not be there; and when they
<BR>have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
<BR>this head off from my shoulders.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>How shall we part with them in setting forth?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
<BR>appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
<BR>our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
<BR>upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
<BR>no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
<BR>horses, by our habits and by every other
<BR>appointment, to be ourselves.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
<BR>in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
<BR>leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
<BR>for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
<BR>true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
<BR>third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
<BR>forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
<BR>incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
<BR>tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
<BR>least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
<BR>extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
<BR>lies the jest.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
<BR>necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
<BR>there I'll sup. Farewell.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Farewell, my lord.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Poins]


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I know you all, and will awhile uphold
<BR>The unyoked humour of your idleness:
<BR>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
<BR>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
<BR>To smother up his beauty from the world,
<BR>That, when he please again to be himself,
<BR>Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
<BR>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
<BR>Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
<BR>If all the year were playing holidays,
<BR>To sport would be as tedious as to work;
<BR>But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
<BR>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
<BR>So, when this loose behavior I throw off
<BR>And pay the debt I never promised,
<BR>By how much better than my word I am,
<BR>By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
<BR>And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
<BR>My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
<BR>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
<BR>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
<BR>I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
<BR>Redeeming time when men think least I will.

<BR>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
<BR>He gave his nose and took't away again;
<BR>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
<BR>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
<BR>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
<BR>He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
<BR>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
<BR>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
<BR>With many holiday and lady terms
<BR>He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
<BR>My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
<BR>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
<BR>To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
<BR>Out of my grief and my impatience,
<BR>Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
<BR>He should or he should not; for he made me mad
<BR>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
<BR>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
<BR>Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
<BR>And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
<BR>Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
<BR>And that it was great pity, so it was,
<BR>This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
<BR>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
<BR>Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
<BR>So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
<BR>He would himself have been a soldier.
<BR>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
<BR>I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
<BR>And I beseech you, let not his report
<BR>Come current for an accusation
<BR>Betwixt my love and your high majesty.

<BR>Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
<BR>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,

<BR>No, on the barren mountains let him starve;

<BR>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,

<BR>When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
<BR>In single opposition, hand to hand,
<BR>He did confound the best part of an hour
<BR>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
<BR>Three times they breathed and three times did
<BR>they drink,
<BR>Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
<BR>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
<BR>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
<BR>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
<BR>Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
<BR>Never did base and rotten policy
<BR>Colour her working with such deadly wounds;

<BR>Receive so many, and all willingly:

<BR>am king of England, I shall command all the good

<BR>cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
<BR>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
<BR>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
<BR>during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
<BR>much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet

<BR>Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
<BR>even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that

<BR>do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my

<BR>prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
<BR>the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
<BR>away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
<BR>for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
<BR>bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
<BR>as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
<BR>What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
<BR>thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
<BR>apparent shame?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
<BR>Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
<BR>heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
<BR>why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
<BR>beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
<BR>prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
<BR>coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
<BR>myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
<BR>lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
<BR>lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
<BR>to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
<BR>Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
<BR>of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
<BR>merry? shall we have a play extempore?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Hostess]


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>O Jesu, my lord the prince!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
<BR>me?


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
<BR>door would speak with you: he says he comes from
<BR>your father.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
<BR>send him back again to my mother.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What manner of man is he?


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>An old man.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
<BR>I give him his answer?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Prithee, do, Jack.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>'Faith, and I'll send him packing.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit FALSTAFF]


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
<BR>Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
<BR>ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
<BR>prince; no, fie!


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
<BR>sword so hacked?


<tr valign=top><td>PETO
<td>Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
<BR>swear truth out of England but he would make you
<BR>believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
<BR>make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
<BR>with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
<BR>did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
<BR>to hear his monstrous devices.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
<BR>ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
<BR>thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
<BR>sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
<BR>instinct hadst thou for it?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
<BR>these exhalations?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I do.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>What think you they portend?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Hot livers and cold purses.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>No, if rightly taken, halter.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter FALSTAFF]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
<BR>How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
<BR>How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
<BR>not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
<BR>crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
<BR>sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
<BR>bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
<BR>Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
<BR>court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
<BR>north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
<BR>bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
<BR>devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
<BR>hook--what a plague call you him?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>O, Glendower.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
<BR>and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of

<BR>perpendicular,--


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
<BR>kills a sparrow flying.

<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY

<BR>for running!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Yes, Jack, upon instinct.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
<BR>and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
<BR>Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
<BR>beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
<BR>land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
<BR>this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
<BR>as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
<BR>shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
<BR>art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
<BR>heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
<BR>such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
<BR>spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
<BR>not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
<BR>it?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
<BR>particulars of my life.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
<BR>this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
<BR>sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
<BR>crown for a pitiful bald crown!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
<BR>now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
<BR>make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
<BR>wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
<BR>in King Cambyses' vein.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well, here is my leg.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>O, the father, how he holds his countenance!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
<BR>For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>Hostess
<td>O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
<BR>players as ever I see!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
<BR>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
<BR>time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
<BR>the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
<BR>it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
<BR>sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
<BR>partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
<BR>but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
<BR>foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
<BR>me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
<BR>why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
<BR>the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
<BR>blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
<BR>the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
<BR>question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
<BR>which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
<BR>many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
<BR>as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
<BR>the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
<BR>speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
<BR>pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
<BR>woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
<BR>have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>What manner of man, an it like your majesty?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
<BR>cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
<BR>carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
<BR>by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
<BR>remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
<BR>should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
<BR>I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
<BR>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
<BR>peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
<BR>Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
<BR>me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
<BR>thou been this month?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
<BR>and I'll play my father.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
<BR>majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
<BR>the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well, here I am set.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>And here I stand: judge, my masters.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Now, Harry, whence come you?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>My noble lord, from Eastcheap.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
<BR>ye for a young prince, i' faith.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
<BR>on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
<BR>there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
<BR>old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
<BR>dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
<BR>bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
<BR>of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
<BR>cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
<BR>the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
<BR>grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
<BR>years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
<BR>drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
<BR>capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
<BR>wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
<BR>but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I would your grace would take me with you: whom
<BR>means your grace?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
<BR>Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>My lord, the man I know.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I know thou dost.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
<BR>were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
<BR>more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
<BR>that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
<BR>that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
<BR>God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
<BR>sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
<BR>to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
<BR>are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
<BR>banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
<BR>Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
<BR>valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
<BR>being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
<BR>thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
<BR>company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
<BR>so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
<BR>as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
<BR>I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.

<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>What men?


<tr valign=top><td>Sheriff
<td>One of them is well known, my gracious lord,

<BR>And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
<BR>That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
<BR>Send him to answer thee, or any man,
<BR>For any thing he shall be charged withal:

<BR>let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
<BR>morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
<BR>shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER]


<tr valign=top><td>MORTIMER
<td>These promises are fair, the parties sure,
<BR>And our induction full of prosperous hope.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
<BR>Will you sit down?
<BR>And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
<BR>I have forgot the map.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>No, here it is.
<BR>Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
<BR>For by that name as oft as Lancaster
<BR>Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
<BR>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>I cannot blame him: at my nativity
<BR>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
<BR>Of burning cressets; and at my birth
<BR>The frame and huge foundation of the earth
<BR>Shaked like a coward.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
<BR>your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
<BR>had never been born.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>I say the earth did shake when I was born.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>And I say the earth was not of my mind,
<BR>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
<BR>And not in fear of your nativity.
<BR>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
<BR>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
<BR>Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
<BR>By the imprisoning of unruly wind
<BR>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
<BR>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
<BR>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
<BR>Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
<BR>In passion shook.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>Cousin, of many men
<BR>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
<BR>To tell you once again that at my birth
<BR>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
<BR>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
<BR>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
<BR>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
<BR>And all the courses of my life do show
<BR>I am not in the roll of common men.
<BR>Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
<BR>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
<BR>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
<BR>And bring him out that is but woman's son
<BR>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
<BR>And hold me pace in deep experiments.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
<BR>I'll to dinner.


<tr valign=top><td>MORTIMER
<td>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Why, so can I, or so can any man;
<BR>But will they come when you do call for them?


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
<BR>The devil.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
<BR>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
<BR>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
<BR>And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
<BR>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!


<tr valign=top><td>MORTIMER
<td>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
<BR>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
<BR>And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
<BR>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
<BR>How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
<BR>According to our threefold order ta'en?


<tr valign=top><td>MORTIMER
<td>The archdeacon hath divided it
<BR>Into three limits very equally:
<BR>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
<BR>By south and east is to my part assign'd:
<BR>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
<BR>And all the fertile land within that bound,
<BR>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
<BR>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
<BR>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
<BR>Which being sealed interchangeably,
<BR>A business that this night may execute,
<BR>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
<BR>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
<BR>To meet your father and the Scottish power,
<BR>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
<BR>My father Glendower is not ready yet,
<BR>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
<BR>Within that space you may have drawn together
<BR>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
<BR>And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
<BR>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
<BR>For there will be a world of water shed
<BR>Upon the parting of your wives and you.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
<BR>In quantity equals not one of yours:
<BR>See how this river comes me cranking in,
<BR>And cuts me from the best of all my land
<BR>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
<BR>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
<BR>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
<BR>In a new channel, fair and evenly;
<BR>It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
<BR>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.


<tr valign=top><td>MORTIMER
<td>Yea, but
<BR>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
<BR>With like advantage on the other side;
<BR>Gelding the opposed continent as much
<BR>As on the other side it takes from you.


<tr valign=top><td>EARL OF WORCESTER
<td>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
<BR>And on this north side win this cape of land;
<BR>And then he runs straight and even.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>I'll not have it alter'd.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Will not you?


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>No, nor you shall not.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Who shall say me nay?


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>Why, that will I.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.


<tr valign=top><td>GLENDOWER
<td>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
<BR>For I was train'd up in the English court;
<BR>Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
<BR>Many an English ditty lovely well
<BR>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
<BR>A virtue that was never seen in you.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>Marry,
<BR>And I am glad of it with all my heart:

<BR>A couching lion and a ramping cat,
<BR>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
<BR>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
<BR>He held me last night at least nine hours
<BR>In reckoning up the several devils' names
<BR>That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
<BR>But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
<BR>As a tired horse, a railing wife;
<BR>Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
<BR>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,

<BR>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion

<BR>He holds your temper in a high respect
<BR>And curbs himself even of his natural scope
<BR>When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:

<BR>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
<BR>And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
<BR>Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
<BR>Defect of manners, want of government,
<BR>Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Lords]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I know not whether God will have it so,
<BR>For some displeasing service I have done,
<BR>That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
<BR>He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
<BR>But thou dost in thy passages of life
<BR>Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
<BR>For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
<BR>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
<BR>Could such inordinate and low desires,
<BR>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
<BR>Such barren pleasures, rude society,
<BR>As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
<BR>Accompany the greatness of thy blood
<BR>And hold their level with thy princely heart?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>So please your majesty, I would I could
<BR>Quit all offences with as clear excuse
<BR>As well as I am doubtless I can purge
<BR>Myself of many I am charged withal:
<BR>Yet such extenuation let me beg,
<BR>As, in reproof of many tales devised,
<BR>which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
<BR>By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
<BR>I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
<BR>Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
<BR>Find pardon on my true submission.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
<BR>At thy affections, which do hold a wing
<BR>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
<BR>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
<BR>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
<BR>And art almost an alien to the hearts
<BR>Of all the court and princes of my blood:
<BR>The hope and expectation of thy time
<BR>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
<BR>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
<BR>Had I so lavish of my presence been,
<BR>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
<BR>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
<BR>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
<BR>Had still kept loyal to possession
<BR>And left me in reputeless banishment,
<BR>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
<BR>By being seldom seen, I could not stir
<BR>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
<BR>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
<BR>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
<BR>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
<BR>And dress'd myself in such humility
<BR>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
<BR>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
<BR>Even in the presence of the crowned king.
<BR>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
<BR>My presence, like a robe pontifical,
<BR>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
<BR>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
<BR>And won by rareness such solemnity.
<BR>The skipping king, he ambled up and down
<BR>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
<BR>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
<BR>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
<BR>Had his great name profaned with their scorns
<BR>And gave his countenance, against his name,
<BR>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
<BR>Of every beardless vain comparative,
<BR>Grew a companion to the common streets,
<BR>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
<BR>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
<BR>They surfeited with honey and began
<BR>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
<BR>More than a little is by much too much.
<BR>So when he had occasion to be seen,
<BR>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
<BR>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
<BR>As, sick and blunted with community,
<BR>Afford no extraordinary gaze,
<BR>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
<BR>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
<BR>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
<BR>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
<BR>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
<BR>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
<BR>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
<BR>For thou has lost thy princely privilege
<BR>With vile participation: not an eye
<BR>But is a-weary of thy common sight,
<BR>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
<BR>Which now doth that I would not have it do,
<BR>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

<BR>And even as I was then is Percy now.
<BR>Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
<BR>He hath more worthy interest to the state
<BR>Than thou the shadow of succession;
<BR>For of no right, nor colour like to right,
<BR>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
<BR>Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
<BR>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
<BR>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
<BR>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
<BR>What never-dying honour hath he got
<BR>Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
<BR>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
<BR>Holds from all soldiers chief majority
<BR>And military title capital
<BR>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
<BR>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
<BR>This infant warrior, in his enterprises
<BR>Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
<BR>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
<BR>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
<BR>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
<BR>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
<BR>The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
<BR>Capitulate against us and are up.
<BR>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
<BR>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
<BR>Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
<BR>Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
<BR>Base inclination and the start of spleen
<BR>To fight against me under Percy's pay,
<BR>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
<BR>To show how much thou art degenerate.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
<BR>And God forgive them that so much have sway'd

<BR>I will redeem all this on Percy's head
<BR>And in the closing of some glorious day
<BR>Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
<BR>When I will wear a garment all of blood
<BR>And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
<BR>Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
<BR>And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
<BR>That this same child of honour and renown,
<BR>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
<BR>And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
<BR>For every honour sitting on his helm,
<BR>Would they were multitudes, and on my head
<BR>My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
<BR>That I shall make this northern youth exchange
<BR>His glorious deeds for my indignities.
<BR>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
<BR>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
<BR>And I will call him to so strict account,
<BR>That he shall render every glory up,
<BR>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
<BR>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
<BR>This, in the name of God, I promise here:
<BR>The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
<BR>I do beseech your majesty may salve
<BR>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
<BR>If not, the end of life cancels all bands;

<BR>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,

<BR>And pardon absolute for yourself and these
<BR>Herein misled by your suggestion.


<tr valign=top><td>HOTSPUR
<td>The king is kind; and well we know the king
<BR>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
<BR>My father and my uncle and myself
<BR>Did give him that same royalty he wears;
<BR>And when he was not six and twenty strong,
<BR>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
<BR>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
<BR>My father gave him welcome to the shore;
<BR>And when he heard him swear and vow to God
<BR>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
<BR>To sue his livery and beg his peace,
<BR>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
<BR>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
<BR>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
<BR>Now when the lords and barons of the realm
<BR>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
<BR>The more and less came in with cap and knee;
<BR>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
<BR>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
<BR>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
<BR>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
<BR>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
<BR>He presently, as greatness knows itself,
<BR>Steps me a little higher than his vow
<BR>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
<BR>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
<BR>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
<BR>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
<BR>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
<BR>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
<BR>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
<BR>This seeming brow of justice, did he win
<BR>The hearts of all that he did angle for;
<BR>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
<BR>Of all the favourites that the absent king
<BR>In deputation left behind him here,
<BR>When he was personal in the Irish war.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR WALTER BLUNT
<td>Tut, I came not to hear this.

<BR>In short time after, he deposed the king;
<BR>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
<BR>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
<BR>To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
<BR>Who is, if every owner were well placed,
<BR>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
<BR>There without ransom to lie forfeited;
<BR>Disgraced me in my happy victories,
<BR>Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
<BR>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
<BR>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
<BR>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
<BR>And in conclusion drove us to seek out
<BR>This head of safety; and withal to pry
<BR>Into his title, the which we find
<BR>Too indirect for long continuance.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[The trumpet sounds]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
<BR>That you and I should meet upon such terms
<BR>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
<BR>And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
<BR>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
<BR>This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
<BR>What say you to it? will you again unknit
<BR>This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
<BR>And move in that obedient orb again
<BR>Where you did give a fair and natural light,
<BR>And be no more an exhaled meteor,
<BR>A prodigy of fear and a portent
<BR>Of broached mischief to the unborn times?


<tr valign=top><td>EARL OF WORCESTER
<td>Hear me, my liege:

<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Peace, chewet, peace!


<tr valign=top><td>EARL OF WORCESTER
<td>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
<BR>Of favour from myself and all our house;
<BR>And yet I must remember you, my lord,
<BR>We were the first and dearest of your friends.
<BR>For you my staff of office did I break
<BR>In Richard's time; and posted day and night
<BR>to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
<BR>When yet you were in place and in account
<BR>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
<BR>It was myself, my brother and his son,
<BR>That brought you home and boldly did outdare
<BR>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
<BR>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
<BR>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
<BR>Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
<BR>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
<BR>To this we swore our aid. But in short space
<BR>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
<BR>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
<BR>What with our help, what with the absent king,
<BR>What with the injuries of a wanton time,
<BR>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
<BR>And the contrarious winds that held the king
<BR>So long in his unlucky Irish wars
<BR>That all in England did repute him dead:
<BR>And from this swarm of fair advantages
<BR>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
<BR>To gripe the general sway into your hand;
<BR>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
<BR>And being fed by us you used us so
<BR>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
<BR>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
<BR>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
<BR>That even our love durst not come near your sight
<BR>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
<BR>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
<BR>Out of sight and raise this present head;
<BR>Whereby we stand opposed by such means
<BR>As you yourself have forged against yourself
<BR>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
<BR>And violation of all faith and troth
<BR>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV

<BR>Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,

<BR>With some fine colour that may please the eye

<BR>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
<BR>Of hurlyburly innovation:
<BR>And never yet did insurrection want
<BR>Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
<BR>Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
<BR>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>In both your armies there is many a soul

<BR>This present enterprise set off his head,
<BR>I do not think a braver gentleman,
<BR>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
<BR>More daring or more bold, is now alive
<BR>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
<BR>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
<BR>I have a truant been to chivalry;
<BR>And so I hear he doth account me too;
<BR>Yet this before my father's majesty--
<BR>I am content that he shall take the odds
<BR>Of his great name and estimation,
<BR>And will, to save the blood on either side,
<BR>Try fortune with him in a single fight.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
<BR>Albeit considerations infinite
<BR>Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
<BR>We love our people well; even those we love
<BR>That are misled upon your cousin's part;
<BR>And, will they take the offer of our grace,
<BR>Both he and they and you, every man
<BR>Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
<BR>So tell your cousin, and bring me word
<BR>What he will do: but if he will not yield,
<BR>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us

<BR>an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
<BR>Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
<BR>honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
<BR>is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
<BR>he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
<BR>Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,

<BR>If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
<BR>I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
<BR>But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
<BR>And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
<BR>For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
<BR>Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
<BR>Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
<BR>But not remember'd in thy epitaph!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]

<tr valign=top><td><td>What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
<BR>Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
<BR>I could have better spared a better man:
<BR>O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
<BR>If I were much in love with vanity!
<BR>Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
<BR>Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
<BR>Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
<BR>Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit PRINCE HENRY]


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
<BR>I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
<BR>to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
<BR>that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
<BR>Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
<BR>is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
<BR>counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
<BR>but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
<BR>liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
<BR>perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
<BR>valour is discretion; in the which better part I
<BR>have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
<BR>gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
<BR>should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
<BR>afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
<BR>Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
<BR>killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
<BR>Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
<BR>Therefore, sirrah,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Stabbing him]

<tr valign=top><td><td>with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Takes up HOTSPUR on his back]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER]


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
<BR>Thy maiden sword.


<tr valign=top><td>LANCASTER
<td>But, soft! whom have we here?
<BR>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I did; I saw him dead,
<BR>Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
<BR>thou alive?
<BR>Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
<BR>I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
<BR>Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
<BR>be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Throwing the body down]

<tr valign=top><td><td>if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
<BR>him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
<BR>earl or duke, I can assure you.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
<BR>lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
<BR>and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
<BR>fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
<BR>believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
<BR>valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
<BR>it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
<BR>thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
<BR>'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.


<tr valign=top><td>LANCASTER
<td>This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
<BR>Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
<BR>For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
<BR>I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[A retreat is sounded]

<tr valign=top><td><td>The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
<BR>Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
<BR>To see what friends are living, who are dead.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER]


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
<BR>rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
<BR>I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
<BR>live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE
<BR>HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND,
<BR>with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners]


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
<BR>Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
<BR>Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
<BR>And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
<BR>Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
<BR>Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
<BR>A noble earl and many a creature else
<BR>Had been alive this hour,
<BR>If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
<BR>Betwixt our armies true intelligence.


<tr valign=top><td>EARL OF WORCESTER
<td>What I have done my safety urged me to;
<BR>And I embrace this fortune patiently,
<BR>Since not to be avoided it falls on me.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
<BR>Other offenders we will pause upon.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How goes the field?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
<BR>The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
<BR>The noble Percy slain, and all his men
<BR>Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
<BR>And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
<BR>That the pursuers took him. At my tent
<BR>The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
<BR>I may dispose of him.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>With all my heart.



<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
<BR>This honourable bounty shall belong:
<BR>Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
<BR>Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
<BR>His valour shown upon our crests to-day
<BR>Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
<BR>Even in the bosom of our adversaries.


<tr valign=top><td>LANCASTER
<td>I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
<BR>Which I shall give away immediately.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>Then this remains, that we divide our power.
<BR>You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
<BR>Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
<BR>To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
<BR>Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
<BR>Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
<BR>To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
<BR>Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
<BR>Meeting the cheque of such another day:
<BR>And since this business so fair is done,
<BR>Let us not leave till all our own be won.
