<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other
<BR>Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>AEGEON
<td>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
<BR>And by the doom of death end woes and all.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SOLINUS
<td>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
<BR>I am not partial to infringe our laws:
<BR>The enmity and discord which of late
<BR>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
<BR>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
<BR>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
<BR>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
<BR>Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
<BR>For, since the mortal and intestine jars
<BR>'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
<BR>It hath in solemn synods been decreed
<BR>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
<BR>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
<BR>If any born at Ephesus be seen
<BR>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
<BR>Again: if any Syracusian born
<BR>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
<BR>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
<BR>Unless a thousand marks be levied,
<BR>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
<BR>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
<BR>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
<BR>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.


<tr valign=top><td>AEGEON
<td>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
<BR>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SOLINUS
<td>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
<BR>Why thou departed'st from thy native home
<BR>And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.


<tr valign=top><td>AEGEON
<td>A heavier task could not have been imposed
<BR>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
<BR>Yet, that the world may witness that my end
<BR>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
<BR>I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
<BR>In Syracusa was I born, and wed
<BR>Unto a woman, happy but for me,
<BR>And by me, had not our hap been bad.
<BR>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
<BR>By prosperous voyages I often made
<BR>To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
<BR>And the great care of goods at random left
<BR>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
<BR>From whom my absence was not six months old
<BR>Before herself, almost at fainting under
<BR>The pleasing punishment that women bear,
<BR>Had made provision for her following me
<BR>And soon and safe arrived where I was.
<BR>There had she not been long, but she became
<BR>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
<BR>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
<BR>As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
<BR>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
<BR>A meaner woman was delivered
<BR>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
<BR>Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
<BR>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
<BR>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
<BR>Made daily motions for our home return:
<BR>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
<BR>We came aboard.
<BR>A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
<BR>Before the always wind-obeying deep
<BR>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
<BR>But longer did we not retain much hope;
<BR>For what obscured light the heavens did grant
<BR>Did but convey unto our fearful minds
<BR>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
<BR>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
<BR>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
<BR>Weeping before for what she saw must come,
<BR>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
<BR>That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
<BR>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
<BR>And this it was, for other means was none:
<BR>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
<BR>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
<BR>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
<BR>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
<BR>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
<BR>To him one of the other twins was bound,
<BR>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
<BR>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
<BR>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
<BR>Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
<BR>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
<BR>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
<BR>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
<BR>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
<BR>And by the benefit of his wished light,
<BR>The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
<BR>Two ships from far making amain to us,
<BR>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
<BR>But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
<BR>Gather the sequel by that went before.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SOLINUS
<td>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
<BR>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.


<tr valign=top><td>AEGEON
<td>O, had the gods done so, I had not now
<BR>Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
<BR>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
<BR>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
<BR>Which being violently borne upon,
<BR>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
<BR>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
<BR>Fortune had left to both of us alike
<BR>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
<BR>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
<BR>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
<BR>Was carried with more speed before the wind;
<BR>And in our sight they three were taken up
<BR>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
<BR>At length, another ship had seized on us;
<BR>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
<BR>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
<BR>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
<BR>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
<BR>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
<BR>Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
<BR>That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
<BR>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SOLINUS
<td>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
<BR>Do me the favour to dilate at full
<BR>What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.


<tr valign=top><td>AEGEON
<td>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
<BR>At eighteen years became inquisitive
<BR>After his brother: and importuned me
<BR>That his attendant--so his case was like,
<BR>Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
<BR>Might bear him company in the quest of him:
<BR>Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
<BR>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
<BR>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
<BR>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
<BR>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
<BR>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
<BR>Or that or any place that harbours men.
<BR>But here must end the story of my life;
<BR>And happy were I in my timely death,
<BR>Could all my travels warrant me they live.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SOLINUS
<td>Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
<BR>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
<BR>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
<BR>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
<BR>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
<BR>My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
<BR>But, though thou art adjudged to the death
<BR>And passed sentence may not be recall'd
<BR>But to our honour's great disparagement,
<BR>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
<BR>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
<BR>To seek thy life by beneficial help:
<BR>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
<BR>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
<BR>And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
<BR>Gaoler, take him to thy custody.


<tr valign=top><td>Gaoler
<td>I will, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>AEGEON
<td>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
<BR>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

<BR>This very day a Syracusian merchant
<BR>Is apprehended for arrival here;

<tr valign=top><td>First Merchant

<BR>The meat is cold because you come not home;
<BR>You come not home because you have no stomach;

<BR>To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?

<BR>I am not in a sportive humour now:
<BR>Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
<BR>We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
<BR>So great a charge from thine own custody?


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF EPHESUS

<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF EPHESUS

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIANA
<td>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,

<BR>Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
<BR>A man is master of his liberty:
<BR>Time is their master, and, when they see time,
<BR>They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.


<tr valign=top><td>ADRIANA
<td>Why should their liberty than ours be more?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCIANA

<tr valign=top><td>ADRIANA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIANA

<tr valign=top><td>ADRIANA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIANA

<BR>There's nothing situate under heaven's eye

<BR>Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
<BR>Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
<BR>Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
<BR>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
<BR>Are masters to their females, and their lords:

<BR>As much or more would we ourselves complain:
<BR>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,

<BR>From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
<BR>Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
<BR>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
<BR>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
<BR>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
<BR>That's not my fault: he's master of my state:

<BR>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
<BR>Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
<BR>Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
<BR>By computation and mine host's report.
<BR>I could not speak with Dromio since at first
<BR>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
<BR>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
<BR>You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
<BR>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
<BR>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
<BR>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS

<BR>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

<BR>Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE

<BR>Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
<BR>And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
<BR>For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
<BR>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE

<BR>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
<BR>Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

<td>Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
<BR>Upon what bargain do you give it me?


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Because that I familiarly sometimes
<BR>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
<BR>Your sauciness will jest upon my love
<BR>And make a common of my serious hours.
<BR>When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
<BR>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
<BR>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
<BR>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
<BR>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
<BR>had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
<BR>long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
<BR>it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.

<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS

<BR>Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
<BR>For urging it the second time to me.

<td>
<BR>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a

<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>By what rule, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
<BR>pate of father Time himself.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Let's hear it.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>There's no time for a man to recover his hair that

<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>May he not do it by fine and recovery?


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
<BR>lost hair of another man.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
<BR>so plentiful an excrement?


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
<BR>and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
<BR>it in a kind of jollity.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>For what reason?


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>For two; and sound ones too.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Nay, not sound, I pray you.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Sure ones, then.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Certain ones then.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>Name them.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>The one, to save the money that he spends in
<BR>trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
<BR>drop in his porridge.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>You would all this time have proved there is no
<BR>time for all things.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
<BR>lost by nature.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE
<td>
<BR>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
<BR>time to recover.


<tr valign=top><td>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
<td>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
<BR>to the world's end will have bald followers.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTIPHOLUS
<BR>OF SYRACUSE

<BR>How dearly would it touch me to the quick,

<BR>And that this body, consecrate to thee,
<BR>By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
<BR>Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
<BR>And hurl the name of husband in my face
<BR>And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
<BR>And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
<BR>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
<BR>I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
<BR>I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
<BR>My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
<BR>For if we too be one and thou play false,
<BR>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,

<BR>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
<BR>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
<BR>'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed

<BR>Being compact of credit, that you love us;
<BR>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
<BR>We in your motion turn and you may move us.

<BR>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.


<tr valign=top><td>AEMELIA

<BR>The venom clamours of a jealous woman

<BR>It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,

<BR>Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
<BR>Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
<BR>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;

<BR>But moody and dull melancholy,
<BR>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
<BR>And at her heels a huge infectious troop
<BR>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
<BR>In food, in sport and life-preserving rest

<BR>This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
<BR>That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
<BR>Could witness it, for he was with me then;
<BR>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
<BR>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
<BR>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.

<BR>To go in person with me to my house.
