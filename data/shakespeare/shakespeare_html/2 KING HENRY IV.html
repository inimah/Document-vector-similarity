<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues]


<tr valign=top><td>RUMOUR
<td>Open your ears; for which of you will stop
<BR>The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
<BR>I, from the orient to the drooping west,
<BR>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
<BR>The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
<BR>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
<BR>The which in every language I pronounce,
<BR>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
<BR>I speak of peace, while covert enmity
<BR>Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
<BR>And who but Rumour, who but only I,
<BR>Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
<BR>Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
<BR>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
<BR>And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
<BR>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
<BR>And of so easy and so plain a stop
<BR>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
<BR>The still-discordant wavering multitude,
<BR>Can play upon it. But what need I thus
<BR>My well-known body to anatomize
<BR>Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
<BR>I run before King Harry's victory;
<BR>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
<BR>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
<BR>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
<BR>Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I
<BR>To speak so true at first? my office is
<BR>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
<BR>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
<BR>And that the king before the Douglas' rage
<BR>Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
<BR>This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
<BR>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
<BR>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
<BR>Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
<BR>Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
<BR>And not a man of them brings other news
<BR>Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
<BR>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than
<BR>true wrongs.

<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Who keeps the gate here, ho?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[The Porter opens the gate]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Where is the earl?


<tr valign=top><td>Porter

<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH

<tr valign=top><td>Porter

<BR>Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Here comes the earl.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit Porter]


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
<BR>Should be the father of some stratagem:
<BR>The times are wild: contention, like a horse
<BR>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
<BR>And bears down all before him.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Noble earl,
<BR>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Good, an God will!


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>As good as heart can wish:
<BR>The king is almost wounded to the death;
<BR>And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
<BR>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
<BR>Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
<BR>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
<BR>And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
<BR>Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,
<BR>So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,
<BR>Came not till now to dignify the times,
<BR>Since Caesar's fortunes!


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>How is this derived?
<BR>Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
<BR>A gentleman well bred and of good name,
<BR>That freely render'd me these news for true.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
<BR>On Tuesday last to listen after news.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter TRAVERS]


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
<BR>And he is furnish'd with no certainties
<BR>More than he haply may retail from me.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?


<tr valign=top><td>TRAVERS
<td>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
<BR>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,
<BR>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
<BR>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
<BR>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
<BR>He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
<BR>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
<BR>He told me that rebellion had bad luck
<BR>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
<BR>With that, he gave his able horse the head,
<BR>And bending forward struck his armed heels
<BR>Against the panting sides of his poor jade
<BR>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
<BR>He seem'd in running to devour the way,
<BR>Staying no longer question.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Ha! Again:
<BR>Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
<BR>Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
<BR>Had met ill luck?


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>My lord, I'll tell you what;
<BR>If my young lord your son have not the day,
<BR>Upon mine honour, for a silken point
<BR>I'll give my barony: never talk of it.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
<BR>Give then such instances of loss?


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Who, he?
<BR>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
<BR>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
<BR>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter MORTON]


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
<BR>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
<BR>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
<BR>Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
<BR>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?


<tr valign=top><td>MORTON
<td>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
<BR>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
<BR>To fright our party.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>How doth my son and brother?
<BR>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
<BR>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
<BR>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
<BR>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
<BR>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
<BR>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
<BR>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
<BR>And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
<BR>This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
<BR>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
<BR>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
<BR>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
<BR>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
<BR>Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'


<tr valign=top><td>MORTON
<td>Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
<BR>But, for my lord your son--


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Why, he is dead.
<BR>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
<BR>He that but fears the thing he would not know
<BR>Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
<BR>That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;
<BR>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
<BR>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
<BR>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.


<tr valign=top><td>MORTON
<td>You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
<BR>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
<BR>I see a strange confession in thine eye:
<BR>Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
<BR>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
<BR>The tongue offends not that reports his death:
<BR>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
<BR>Not he which says the dead is not alive.
<BR>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
<BR>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
<BR>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
<BR>Remember'd tolling a departing friend.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.


<tr valign=top><td>MORTON
<td>I am sorry I should force you to believe
<BR>That which I would to God I had not seen;
<BR>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
<BR>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,
<BR>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
<BR>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
<BR>From whence with life he never more sprung up.
<BR>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
<BR>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
<BR>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
<BR>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
<BR>For from his metal was his party steel'd;
<BR>Which once in him abated, all the rest
<BR>Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
<BR>And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
<BR>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
<BR>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
<BR>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
<BR>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
<BR>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
<BR>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
<BR>Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
<BR>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
<BR>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
<BR>'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
<BR>Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
<BR>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
<BR>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
<BR>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
<BR>Under the conduct of young Lancaster
<BR>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
<BR>In poison there is physic; and these news,
<BR>Having been well, that would have made me sick,
<BR>Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
<BR>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
<BR>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
<BR>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
<BR>Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
<BR>Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,
<BR>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
<BR>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
<BR>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
<BR>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
<BR>Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
<BR>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
<BR>The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
<BR>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
<BR>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
<BR>Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
<BR>And let this world no longer be a stage
<BR>To feed contention in a lingering act;
<BR>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
<BR>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
<BR>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
<BR>And darkness be the burier of the dead!


<tr valign=top><td>TRAVERS
<td>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.


<tr valign=top><td>MORTON
<td>The lives of all your loving complices
<BR>Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
<BR>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
<BR>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
<BR>And summ'd the account of chance, before you said
<BR>'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,
<BR>That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:
<BR>You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,
<BR>More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
<BR>You were advised his flesh was capable
<BR>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
<BR>Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
<BR>Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,
<BR>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
<BR>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
<BR>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
<BR>More than that being which was like to be?


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>We all that are engaged to this loss
<BR>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
<BR>That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;
<BR>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
<BR>Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
<BR>And since we are o'erset, venture again.
<BR>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.


<tr valign=top><td>MORTON
<td>'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
<BR>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
<BR>The gentle Archbishop of York is up
<BR>With well-appointed powers: he is a man
<BR>Who with a double surety binds his followers.
<BR>My lord your son had only but the corpse,
<BR>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
<BR>For that same word, rebellion, did divide
<BR>The action of their bodies from their souls;
<BR>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
<BR>As men drink potions, that their weapons only
<BR>Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,
<BR>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
<BR>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
<BR>Turns insurrection to religion:
<BR>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,
<BR>He's followed both with body and with mind;
<BR>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
<BR>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;
<BR>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
<BR>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
<BR>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
<BR>And more and less do flock to follow him.


<tr valign=top><td>NORTHUMBERLAND
<td>I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
<BR>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
<BR>Go in with me; and counsel every man
<BR>The aptest way for safety and revenge:
<BR>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
<BR>Never so few, and never yet more need.

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
<BR>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not
<BR>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more
<BR>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
<BR>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other
<BR>men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
<BR>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
<BR>prince put thee into my service for any other reason
<BR>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
<BR>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn
<BR>in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
<BR>manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
<BR>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and
<BR>send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--
<BR>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is
<BR>not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
<BR>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
<BR>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
<BR>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis
<BR>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a
<BR>face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence
<BR>out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
<BR>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
<BR>may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,
<BR>I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
<BR>the satin for my short cloak and my slops?

<BR>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
<BR>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
<BR>through with them in honest taking up, then they
<BR>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
<BR>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
<BR>security. I looked a' should have sent me two and
<BR>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he
<BR>sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;

<tr valign=top><td>Servant
<td>Sir, my lord would speak with you.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
<BR>day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
<BR>say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
<BR>goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not
<BR>clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in
<BR>you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must
<BR>humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
<BR>of your health.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
<BR>Shrewsbury.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is
<BR>returned with some discomfort from Wales.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
<BR>I sent for you.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into
<BR>this same whoreson apoplexy.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with
<BR>you.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,
<BR>an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
<BR>blood, a whoreson tingling.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>What tell you me of it? be it as it is.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>It hath its original from much grief, from study and
<BR>perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
<BR>his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>I think you are fallen into the disease; for you
<BR>hear not what I say to you.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please
<BR>you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady
<BR>of not marking, that I am troubled withal.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>To punish you by the heels would amend the
<BR>attention of your ears; and I care not if I do
<BR>become your physician.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:
<BR>your lordship may minister the potion of
<BR>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
<BR>should I be your patient to follow your
<BR>prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a
<BR>scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>I sent for you, when there were matters against you
<BR>for your life, to come speak with me.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the
<BR>laws of this land-service, I did not come.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
<BR>greater, and my waist slenderer.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>You have misled the youthful prince.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow
<BR>with the great belly, and he my dog.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your
<BR>day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
<BR>over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may
<BR>thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting
<BR>that action.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>My lord?


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
<BR>sleeping wolf.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
<BR>out.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say
<BR>of wax, my growth would approve the truth.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>There is not a white hair on your face but should
<BR>have his effect of gravity.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>You follow the young prince up and down, like his
<BR>ill angel.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope
<BR>he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
<BR>and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I
<BR>cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
<BR>costermonger times that true valour is turned
<BR>bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath
<BR>his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
<BR>other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
<BR>this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.
<BR>You that are old consider not the capacities of us
<BR>that are young; you do measure the heat of our
<BR>livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
<BR>that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,
<BR>are wags too.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
<BR>that are written down old with all the characters of
<BR>age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a
<BR>yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
<BR>increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
<BR>wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
<BR>every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
<BR>will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the
<BR>afternoon, with a white head and something a round
<BR>belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing
<BR>and singing of anthems. To approve my youth
<BR>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in
<BR>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
<BR>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the
<BR>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that
<BR>the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
<BR>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
<BR>chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
<BR>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
<BR>and old sack.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Well, God send the prince a better companion!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>God send the companion a better prince! I cannot
<BR>rid my hands of him.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I
<BR>hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
<BR>against the Archbishop and the Earl of
<BR>Northumberland.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
<BR>you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
<BR>that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the
<BR>Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean
<BR>not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,
<BR>and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I
<BR>might never spit white again. There is not a
<BR>dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
<BR>thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
<BR>was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if
<BR>they have a good thing, to make it too common. If
<BR>ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give
<BR>me rest. I would to God my name were not so
<BR>terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
<BR>eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
<BR>nothing with perpetual motion.


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice

<BR>cousin Westmoreland.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant]


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;

<BR>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
<BR>And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?


<tr valign=top><td>MOWBRAY
<td>I well allow the occasion of our arms;
<BR>But gladly would be better satisfied
<BR>How in our means we should advance ourselves
<BR>To look with forehead bold and big enough
<BR>Upon the power and puissance of the king.


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>Our present musters grow upon the file
<BR>To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
<BR>And our supplies live largely in the hope
<BR>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
<BR>With an incensed fire of injuries.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;
<BR>Whether our present five and twenty thousand
<BR>May hold up head without Northumberland?


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>With him, we may.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Yea, marry, there's the point:
<BR>But if without him we be thought too feeble,
<BR>My judgment is, we should not step too far
<BR>Till we had his assistance by the hand;
<BR>For in a theme so bloody-faced as this
<BR>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
<BR>Of aids incertain should not be admitted.


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed
<BR>It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
<BR>Eating the air on promise of supply,
<BR>Flattering himself in project of a power
<BR>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:
<BR>And so, with great imagination
<BR>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death
<BR>And winking leap'd into destruction.


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
<BR>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Yes, if this present quality of war,
<BR>Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
<BR>Lives so in hope as in an early spring
<BR>We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,
<BR>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
<BR>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
<BR>We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
<BR>And when we see the figure of the house,
<BR>Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
<BR>Which if we find outweighs ability,
<BR>What do we then but draw anew the model
<BR>In fewer offices, or at last desist
<BR>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,
<BR>Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
<BR>And set another up, should we survey
<BR>The plot of situation and the model,
<BR>Consent upon a sure foundation,
<BR>Question surveyors, know our own estate,
<BR>How able such a work to undergo,
<BR>To weigh against his opposite; or else
<BR>We fortify in paper and in figures,
<BR>Using the names of men instead of men:
<BR>Like one that draws the model of a house
<BR>Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
<BR>Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
<BR>A naked subject to the weeping clouds
<BR>And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
<BR>Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
<BR>The utmost man of expectation,
<BR>I think we are a body strong enough,
<BR>Even as we are, to equal with the king.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
<BR>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
<BR>Are in three heads: one power against the French,
<BR>And one against Glendower; perforce a third
<BR>Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
<BR>In three divided; and his coffers sound
<BR>With hollow poverty and emptiness.


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>That he should draw his several strengths together
<BR>And come against us in full puissance,
<BR>Need not be dreaded.


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>If he should do so,
<BR>He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
<BR>Baying him at the heels: never fear that.


<tr valign=top><td>LORD BARDOLPH
<td>Who is it like should lead his forces hither?


<tr valign=top><td>HASTINGS
<td>The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;

<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>Let us on,

<BR>The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
<BR>Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:
<BR>An habitation giddy and unsure
<BR>Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
<BR>O thou fond many, with what loud applause
<BR>Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,
<BR>Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
<BR>And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
<BR>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,
<BR>That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.
<BR>So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
<BR>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;
<BR>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
<BR>And howl'st to find it. What trust is in
<BR>these times?
<BR>They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,
<BR>Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
<BR>Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
<BR>When through proud London he came sighing on
<BR>After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
<BR>Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,
<BR>And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!
<BR>Past and to come seems best; things present worst.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Before God, I am exceeding weary.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
<BR>have attached one of so high blood.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
<BR>complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
<BR>it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
<BR>to remember so weak a composition.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
<BR>by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
<BR>small beer. But, indeed, these humble
<BR>considerations make me out of love with my
<BR>greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
<BR>thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
<BR>take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
<BR>hast, viz. these, and those that were thy
<BR>peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
<BR>shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for
<BR>use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
<BR>than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
<BR>thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
<BR>a great while, because the rest of thy low
<BR>countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
<BR>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins
<BR>of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
<BR>midwives say the children are not in the fault;
<BR>whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
<BR>mightily strengthened.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
<BR>you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
<BR>young princes would do so, their fathers being so
<BR>sick as yours at this time is?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
<BR>will tell.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
<BR>sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
<BR>thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
<BR>better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
<BR>indeed too.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Very hardly upon such a subject.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
<BR>book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
<BR>persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
<BR>thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
<BR>sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
<BR>hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>The reason?


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
<BR>blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never
<BR>a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
<BR>better than thine: every man would think me an
<BR>hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
<BR>worshipful thought to think so?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
<BR>engraffed to Falstaff.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>And to thee.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
<BR>with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
<BR>me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
<BR>proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I
<BR>confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BARDOLPH and Page]

<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>God save your grace!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>And yours, most noble Bardolph!


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you
<BR>be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a
<BR>maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a
<BR>matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?


<tr valign=top><td>Page
<td>A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red
<BR>lattice, and I could discern no part of his face
<BR>from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and
<BR>methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's
<BR>new petticoat and so peeped through.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Has not the boy profited?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!


<tr valign=top><td>Page
<td>Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?


<tr valign=top><td>Page
<td>Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered
<BR>of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,
<BR>boy.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>O, that this good blossom could be kept from
<BR>cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>An you do not make him hanged among you, the
<BR>gallows shall have wrong.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>And how doth thy master, Bardolph?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to
<BR>town: there's a letter for you.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Delivered with good respect. And how doth the
<BR>martlemas, your master?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>In bodily health, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but
<BR>that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies
<BR>not.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
<BR>dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must
<BR>know that, as oft as he has occasion to name
<BR>himself: even like those that are kin to the king;
<BR>for they never prick their finger but they say,
<BR>'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How
<BR>comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to
<BR>conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's
<BR>cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it
<BR>from Japhet. But to the letter.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of
<BR>the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of
<BR>Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Peace!


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in
<BR>brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,
<BR>short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend
<BR>thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with
<BR>Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he
<BR>swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent
<BR>at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
<BR>Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to
<BR>say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my
<BR>familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,
<BR>and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'
<BR>My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do
<BR>you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the
<BR>spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
<BR>Is your master here in London?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Yea, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY

<BR>Mistress Doll Tearsheet.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>What pagan may that be?


<tr valign=top><td>Page
<td>A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
<BR>bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?


<tr valign=top><td>POINS
<td>I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
<BR>master that I am yet come to town: there's for
<BR>your silence.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH

<tr valign=top><td>Page

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page]

<tr valign=top><td><td>This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.


<tr valign=top><td>POINS

<BR>The time was, father, that you broke your word,

<BR>When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
<BR>Threw many a northward look to see his father
<BR>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
<BR>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
<BR>There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
<BR>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
<BR>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
<BR>In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
<BR>Did all the chivalry of England move
<BR>To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
<BR>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
<BR>He had no legs that practised not his gait;
<BR>And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
<BR>Became the accents of the valiant;
<BR>For those that could speak low and tardily
<BR>Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
<BR>To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
<BR>In diet, in affections of delight,
<BR>In military rules, humours of blood,
<BR>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
<BR>That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!
<BR>O miracle of men! him did you leave,
<BR>Second to none, unseconded by you,
<BR>To look upon the hideous god of war
<BR>In disadvantage; to abide a field
<BR>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
<BR>Did seem defensible: so you left him.
<BR>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
<BR>To hold your honour more precise and nice
<BR>With others than with him! let them alone:

<tr valign=top><td>SILENCE
<td>Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BARDOLPH and one with him]


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which
<BR>is Justice Shallow?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this
<BR>county, and one of the king's justices of the peace:
<BR>What is your good pleasure with me?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,
<BR>Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and
<BR>a most gallant leader.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword
<BR>man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my
<BR>lady his wife doth?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than
<BR>with a wife.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said
<BR>indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,
<BR>indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever
<BR>were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of
<BR>'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call
<BR>you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;
<BR>but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a
<BR>soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good
<BR>command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a
<BR>man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,
<BR>being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;
<BR>which is an excellent thing.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>It is very just.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter FALSTAFF]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good
<BR>hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my
<BR>troth, you like well and bear your years very well:
<BR>welcome, good Sir John.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert
<BR>Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>the peace.


<tr valign=top><td>SILENCE

<BR>provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as
<BR>I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me
<BR>see; where is Mouldy?


<tr valign=top><td>MOULDY

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Is thy name Mouldy?


<tr valign=top><td>MOULDY
<td>Yea, an't please you.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>'Tis the more time thou wert used.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that
<BR>are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,
<BR>well said, Sir John, very well said.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Prick him.


<tr valign=top><td>MOULDY
<td>I was pricked well enough before, an you could have
<BR>let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for
<BR>one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need
<BR>not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter
<BR>to go out than I.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is
<BR>time you were spent.


<tr valign=top><td>MOULDY
<td>Spent!


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where
<BR>you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:
<BR>Simon Shadow!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like
<BR>to be a cold soldier.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Where's Shadow?


<tr valign=top><td>SHADOW
<td>Here, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Shadow, whose son art thou?


<tr valign=top><td>SHADOW
<td>My mother's son, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's
<BR>shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of
<BR>the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the
<BR>father's substance!


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Do you like him, Sir John?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have
<BR>a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Thomas Wart!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Where's he?


<tr valign=top><td>WART
<td>Here, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Is thy name Wart?


<tr valign=top><td>WART
<td>Yea, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Thou art a very ragged wart.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Shall I prick him down, Sir John?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon
<BR>his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:
<BR>prick him no more.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I
<BR>commend you well. Francis Feeble!


<tr valign=top><td>FEEBLE
<td>Here, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What trade art thou, Feeble?


<tr valign=top><td>FEEBLE
<td>A woman's tailor, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Shall I prick him, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld
<BR>ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in
<BR>an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?


<tr valign=top><td>FEEBLE
<td>I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,
<BR>courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the
<BR>wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the
<BR>woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.


<tr valign=top><td>FEEBLE
<td>I would Wart might have gone, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst
<BR>mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him
<BR>to a private soldier that is the leader of so many
<BR>thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.


<tr valign=top><td>FEEBLE
<td>It shall suffice, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Peter Bullcalf o' the green!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.


<tr valign=top><td>BULLCALF
<td>Here, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>till he roar again.


<tr valign=top><td>BULLCALF
<td>O Lord! good my lord captain,--


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?


<tr valign=top><td>BULLCALF
<td>O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What disease hast thou?


<tr valign=top><td>BULLCALF
<td>A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught
<BR>with ringing in the king's affairs upon his
<BR>coronation-day, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt
<BR>have away thy cold; and I will take such order that
<BR>my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Here is two more called than your number, you must
<BR>have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in
<BR>with me to dinner.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry
<BR>dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night
<BR>in the windmill in Saint George's field?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>She lives, Master Shallow.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>She never could away with me.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Never, never; she would always say she could not
<BR>abide Master Shallow.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She
<BR>was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Old, old, Master Shallow.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
<BR>certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old
<BR>Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.


<tr valign=top><td>SILENCE
<td>That's fifty-five year ago.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that
<BR>this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
<BR>Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'
<BR>Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:
<BR>Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.

<BR>I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,
<BR>and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with

<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH

<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH

<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are
<BR>your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a
<BR>man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,
<BR>bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the

<BR>ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and
<BR>discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's
<BR>hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets
<BR>on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced
<BR>fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
<BR>mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
<BR>level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;
<BR>how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run
<BR>off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the
<BR>great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'
<BR>faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a
<BR>tester for thee.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
<BR>right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at
<BR>Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
<BR>show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'
<BR>would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
<BR>and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,
<BR>tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and
<BR>away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I
<BR>shall ne'er see such a fellow.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God
<BR>keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words
<BR>with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank
<BR>you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give
<BR>the soldiers coats.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW

<tr valign=top><td><td>On, Bardolph; lead the men away.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, &amp;c]

<tr valign=top><td><td>As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do
<BR>see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how
<BR>subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This
<BR>same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
<BR>me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he
<BR>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
<BR>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's
<BR>tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a
<BR>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'
<BR>was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
<BR>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
<BR>with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his
<BR>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'
<BR>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a
<BR>monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came
<BR>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those
<BR>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
<BR>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or
<BR>his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger
<BR>become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a
<BR>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
<BR>I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the
<BR>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
<BR>among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a
<BR>Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
<BR>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
<BR>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
<BR>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll
<BR>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
<BR>go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two
<BR>stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
<BR>old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
<BR>may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:
<BR>What doth concern your coming?


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>Then, my lord,
<BR>Unto your grace do I in chief address
<BR>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
<BR>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
<BR>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
<BR>And countenanced by boys and beggary,
<BR>I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,
<BR>In his true, native and most proper shape,
<BR>You, reverend father, and these noble lords
<BR>Had not been here, to dress the ugly form
<BR>Of base and bloody insurrection
<BR>With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
<BR>Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
<BR>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
<BR>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
<BR>Whose white investments figure innocence,
<BR>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
<BR>Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
<BR>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
<BR>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
<BR>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
<BR>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
<BR>To a trumpet and a point of war?


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
<BR>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
<BR>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
<BR>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
<BR>And we must bleed for it; of which disease
<BR>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
<BR>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
<BR>I take not on me here as a physician,
<BR>Nor do I as an enemy to peace
<BR>Troop in the throngs of military men;
<BR>But rather show awhile like fearful war,
<BR>To diet rank minds sick of happiness
<BR>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
<BR>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
<BR>I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
<BR>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
<BR>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
<BR>We see which way the stream of time doth run,
<BR>And are enforced from our most quiet there
<BR>By the rough torrent of occasion;
<BR>And have the summary of all our griefs,
<BR>When time shall serve, to show in articles;
<BR>Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
<BR>And might by no suit gain our audience:
<BR>When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
<BR>We are denied access unto his person
<BR>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
<BR>The dangers of the days but newly gone,
<BR>Whose memory is written on the earth
<BR>With yet appearing blood, and the examples
<BR>Of every minute's instance, present now,
<BR>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
<BR>Not to break peace or any branch of it,
<BR>But to establish here a peace indeed,
<BR>Concurring both in name and quality.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>When ever yet was your appeal denied?
<BR>Wherein have you been galled by the king?
<BR>What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,
<BR>That you should seal this lawless bloody book
<BR>Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
<BR>And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?


<tr valign=top><td>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<td>My brother general, the commonwealth,
<BR>To brother born an household cruelty,
<BR>I make my quarrel in particular.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>There is no need of any such redress;
<BR>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.


<tr valign=top><td>MOWBRAY
<td>Why not to him in part, and to us all
<BR>That feel the bruises of the days before,
<BR>And suffer the condition of these times
<BR>To lay a heavy and unequal hand
<BR>Upon our honours?


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>O, my good Lord Mowbray,
<BR>Construe the times to their necessities,
<BR>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,
<BR>And not the king, that doth you injuries.
<BR>Yet for your part, it not appears to me
<BR>Either from the king or in the present time
<BR>That you should have an inch of any ground
<BR>To build a grief on: were you not restored
<BR>To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,
<BR>Your noble and right well remember'd father's?


<tr valign=top><td>MOWBRAY
<td>What thing, in honour, had my father lost,
<BR>That need to be revived and breathed in me?
<BR>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,
<BR>Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
<BR>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,
<BR>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
<BR>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
<BR>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
<BR>Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
<BR>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
<BR>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
<BR>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
<BR>O when the king did throw his warder down,
<BR>His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
<BR>Then threw he down himself and all their lives
<BR>That by indictment and by dint of sword
<BR>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
<BR>The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
<BR>In England the most valiant gentlemen:
<BR>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
<BR>But if your father had been victor there,
<BR>He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:
<BR>For all the country in a general voice
<BR>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
<BR>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
<BR>And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.
<BR>But this is mere digression from my purpose.
<BR>Here come I from our princely general
<BR>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
<BR>That he will give you audience; and wherein
<BR>It shall appear that your demands are just,
<BR>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off
<BR>That might so much as think you enemies.


<tr valign=top><td>MOWBRAY
<td>But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
<BR>And it proceeds from policy, not love.


<tr valign=top><td>WESTMORELAND
<td>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
<BR>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:
<BR>For, lo! within a ken our army lies,
<BR>Upon mine honour, all too confident
<BR>To give admittance to a thought of fear.
<BR>Our battle is more full of names than yours,
<BR>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,

<BR>In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,
<BR>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
<BR>How deep you were within the books of God?
<BR>To us the speaker in his parliament;
<BR>To us the imagined voice of God himself;
<BR>The very opener and intelligencer
<BR>Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
<BR>And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
<BR>But you misuse the reverence of your place,

<BR>To hold our safety up. I sent your grace
<BR>The parcels and particulars of our grief,
<BR>The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,
<BR>Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
<BR>Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep

<BR>And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
<BR>Whiles England shall have generation.

<BR>My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
<BR>Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
<BR>Discharge your powers unto their several counties,

<BR>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
<BR>him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.
<BR>There's never none of these demure boys come to any
<BR>proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
<BR>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a
<BR>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
<BR>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
<BR>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
<BR>inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
<BR>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
<BR>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
<BR>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
<BR>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
<BR>delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the
<BR>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
<BR>excellent wit. The second property of your
<BR>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;
<BR>which, before cold and settled, left the liver
<BR>white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
<BR>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
<BR>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
<BR>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
<BR>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
<BR>man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
<BR>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
<BR>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
<BR>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
<BR>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
<BR>nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
<BR>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
<BR>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
<BR>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
<BR>the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
<BR>father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
<BR>manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
<BR>endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
<BR>sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
<BR>I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
<BR>would teach them should be, to forswear thin
<BR>potations and to addict themselves to sack.

<BR>Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.
<BR>Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
<BR>Is held from falling with so weak a wind
<BR>That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
<BR>Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
<BR>Were thine without offence; and at my death
<BR>Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
<BR>Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,
<BR>And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
<BR>Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
<BR>Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
<BR>To stab at half an hour of my life.
<BR>What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
<BR>Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
<BR>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
<BR>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
<BR>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
<BR>Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
<BR>Only compound me with forgotten dust
<BR>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
<BR>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;

<BR>Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!
<BR>Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
<BR>And to the English court assemble now,

<BR>Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:

<BR>England shall give him office, honour, might;
<BR>For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
<BR>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
<BR>Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
<BR>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
<BR>When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
<BR>What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
<BR>O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
<BR>Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY
<td>O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,
<BR>The moist impediments unto my speech,
<BR>I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
<BR>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
<BR>The course of it so far. There is your crown;
<BR>And He that wears the crown immortally
<BR>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
<BR>Than as your honour and as your renown,
<BR>Let me no more from this obedience rise,
<BR>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
<BR>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
<BR>God witness with me, when I here came in,
<BR>And found no course of breath within your majesty,
<BR>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
<BR>O, let me in my present wildness die
<BR>And never live to show the incredulous world
<BR>The noble change that I have purposed!
<BR>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
<BR>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
<BR>I spake unto this crown as having sense,
<BR>And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
<BR>Hath fed upon the body of my father;
<BR>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
<BR>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
<BR>Preserving life in medicine potable;
<BR>But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,
<BR>Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,
<BR>Accusing it, I put it on my head,
<BR>To try with it, as with an enemy
<BR>That had before my face murder'd my father,
<BR>The quarrel of a true inheritor.
<BR>But if it did infect my blood with joy,
<BR>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
<BR>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
<BR>Did with the least affection of a welcome
<BR>Give entertainment to the might of it,
<BR>Let God for ever keep it from my head
<BR>And make me as the poorest vassal is
<BR>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY IV
<td>O my son,
<BR>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
<BR>That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
<BR>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
<BR>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
<BR>And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
<BR>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
<BR>By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
<BR>I met this crown; and I myself know well
<BR>How troublesome it sat upon my head.
<BR>To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,
<BR>Better opinion, better confirmation;
<BR>For all the soil of the achievement goes
<BR>With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
<BR>But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
<BR>And I had many living to upbraid
<BR>My gain of it by their assistances;
<BR>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
<BR>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
<BR>Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
<BR>For all my reign hath been but as a scene
<BR>Acting that argument: and now my death
<BR>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,
<BR>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
<BR>So thou the garland wear'st successively.
<BR>Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
<BR>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
<BR>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
<BR>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
<BR>By whose fell working I was first advanced
<BR>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
<BR>To be again displaced: which to avoid,
<BR>I cut them off; and had a purpose now
<BR>To lead out many to the Holy Land,
<BR>Lest rest and lying still might make them look
<BR>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
<BR>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
<BR>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
<BR>May waste the memory of the former days.
<BR>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
<BR>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
<BR>How I came by the crown, O God forgive;
<BR>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!


<tr valign=top><td>PRINCE HENRY

<BR>You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;

<BR>May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?


<tr valign=top><td>Lord Chief-Justice
<td>I then did use the person of your father;
<BR>The image of his power lay then in me:
<BR>And, in the administration of his law,
<BR>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
<BR>Your highness pleased to forget my place,
<BR>The majesty and power of law and justice,
<BR>The image of the king whom I presented,
<BR>And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
<BR>Whereon, as an offender to your father,
<BR>I gave bold way to my authority
<BR>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
<BR>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
<BR>To have a son set your decrees at nought,
<BR>To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
<BR>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
<BR>That guards the peace and safety of your person;
<BR>Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image
<BR>And mock your workings in a second body.
<BR>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
<BR>Be now the father and propose a son,
<BR>Hear your own dignity so much profaned,
<BR>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
<BR>Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
<BR>And then imagine me taking your part
<BR>And in your power soft silencing your son:
<BR>After this cold considerance, sentence me;
<BR>And, as you are a king, speak in your state
<BR>What I have done that misbecame my place,
<BR>My person, or my liege's sovereignty.


<tr valign=top><td>KING HENRY V
<td>You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;
<BR>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
<BR>And I do wish your honours may increase,
<BR>Till you do live to see a son of mine
<BR>Offend you and obey you, as I did.
<BR>So shall I live to speak my father's words:
<BR>'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
<BR>That dares do justice on my proper son;
<BR>And not less happy, having such a son,
<BR>That would deliver up his greatness so
<BR>Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:
<BR>For which, I do commit into your hand
<BR>The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
<BR>With this remembrance, that you use the same
<BR>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit
<BR>As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.
<BR>You shall be as a father to my youth:
<BR>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
<BR>And I will stoop and humble my intents
<BR>To your well-practised wise directions.
<BR>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
<BR>My father is gone wild into his grave,
<BR>For in his tomb lie my affections;
<BR>And with his spirit sadly I survive,
<BR>To mock the expectation of the world,
<BR>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
<BR>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
<BR>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
<BR>Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:
<BR>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
<BR>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
<BR>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
<BR>Now call we our high court of parliament:
<BR>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
<BR>That the great body of our state may go
<BR>In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
<BR>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
<BR>As things acquainted and familiar to us;
<BR>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
<BR>Our coronation done, we will accite,
<BR>As I before remember'd, all our state:
<BR>And, God consigning to my good intents,
<BR>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
<BR>God shorten Harry's happy life one day!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Spoken by a Dancer]

<tr valign=top><td><td>First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.
<BR>My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
<BR>and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
<BR>for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
<BR>to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
<BR>should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
<BR>But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
<BR>known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
<BR>in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
<BR>patience for it and to promise you a better. I
<BR>meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an
<BR>ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
<BR>you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
<BR>I would be and here I commit my body to your
<BR>mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
<BR>as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.

<tr valign=top><td><td>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
<BR>you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
<BR>light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
<BR>good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
<BR>and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
<BR>forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
<BR>gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which
<BR>was never seen before in such an assembly.

<tr valign=top><td><td>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
<BR>much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
<BR>continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make
<BR>you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for
<BR>any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,
<BR>unless already a' be killed with your hard
<BR>opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is
<BR>not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
<BR>too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down
<BR>before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.
