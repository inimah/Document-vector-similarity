<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and
<BR>others, at several doors]


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Good day, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>I am glad you're well.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>I have not seen you long: how goes the world?


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>It wears, sir, as it grows.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Ay, that's well known:
<BR>But what particular rarity? what strange,
<BR>Which manifold record not matches? See,
<BR>Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
<BR>Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>O, 'tis a worthy lord.


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller
<td>Nay, that's most fix'd.


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
<BR>To an untirable and continuate goodness:
<BR>He passes.


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller:
<td>I have a jewel here--


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller:
<td>If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
<BR>praised the vile,
<BR>It stains the glory in that happy verse
<BR>Which aptly sings the good.'


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>'Tis a good form.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Looking at the jewel]


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller
<td>And rich: here is a water, look ye.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
<BR>To the great lord.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>A thing slipp'd idly from me.
<BR>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
<BR>From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
<BR>Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
<BR>Provokes itself and like the current flies
<BR>Each bound it chafes. What have you there?


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
<BR>Let's see your piece.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>'Tis a good piece.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>Indifferent.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Admirable: how this grace
<BR>Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
<BR>This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
<BR>Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
<BR>One might interpret.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>It is a pretty mocking of the life.
<BR>Here is a touch; is't good?


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>I will say of it,
<BR>It tutors nature: artificial strife
<BR>Lives in these touches, livelier than life.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter certain Senators, and pass over]


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>How this lord is follow'd!


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>The senators of Athens: happy man!


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>Look, more!


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>You see this confluence, this great flood
<BR>of visitors.
<BR>I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
<BR>Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
<BR>With amplest entertainment: my free drift
<BR>Halts not particularly, but moves itself
<BR>In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
<BR>Infects one comma in the course I hold;
<BR>But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
<BR>Leaving no tract behind.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>How shall I understand you?


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>I will unbolt to you.
<BR>You see how all conditions, how all minds,
<BR>As well of glib and slippery creatures as
<BR>Of grave and austere quality, tender down
<BR>Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
<BR>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
<BR>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
<BR>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
<BR>To Apemantus, that few things loves better
<BR>Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
<BR>The knee before him, and returns in peace
<BR>Most rich in Timon's nod.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>I saw them speak together.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
<BR>Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
<BR>Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
<BR>That labour on the bosom of this sphere
<BR>To propagate their states: amongst them all,
<BR>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
<BR>One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
<BR>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
<BR>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
<BR>Translates his rivals.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>'Tis conceived to scope.
<BR>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
<BR>With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
<BR>Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
<BR>To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
<BR>In our condition.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Nay, sir, but hear me on.
<BR>All those which were his fellows but of late,
<BR>Some better than his value, on the moment
<BR>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
<BR>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
<BR>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
<BR>Drink the free air.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>Ay, marry, what of these?


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
<BR>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
<BR>Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
<BR>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
<BR>Not one accompanying his declining foot.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>'Tis common:
<BR>A thousand moral paintings I can show
<BR>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
<BR>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
<BR>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
<BR>The foot above the head.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself
<BR>courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
<BR>VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
<BR>servants following]


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Imprison'd is he, say you?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
<BR>His means most short, his creditors most strait:
<BR>Your honourable letter he desires
<BR>To those have shut him up; which failing,
<BR>Periods his comfort.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Noble Ventidius! Well;
<BR>I am not of that feather to shake off
<BR>My friend when he must need me. I do know him
<BR>A gentleman that well deserves a help:
<BR>Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
<BR>and free him.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>Your lordship ever binds him.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
<BR>And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
<BR>'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
<BR>But to support him after. Fare you well.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>All happiness to your honour!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter an old Athenian]


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>Lord Timon, hear me speak.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Freely, good father.


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>I have so: what of him?


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!


<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>Here, at your lordship's service.


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
<BR>By night frequents my house. I am a man
<BR>That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
<BR>And my estate deserves an heir more raised
<BR>Than one which holds a trencher.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Well; what further?


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>One only daughter have I, no kin else,
<BR>On whom I may confer what I have got:
<BR>The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
<BR>And I have bred her at my dearest cost
<BR>In qualities of the best. This man of thine
<BR>Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
<BR>Join with me to forbid him her resort;
<BR>Myself have spoke in vain.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>The man is honest.


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>Therefore he will be, Timon:
<BR>His honesty rewards him in itself;
<BR>It must not bear my daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Does she love him?


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>She is young and apt:
<BR>Our own precedent passions do instruct us
<BR>What levity's in youth.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>If in her marriage my consent be missing,
<BR>I call the gods to witness, I will choose
<BR>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
<BR>And dispossess her all.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>How shall she be endow'd,
<BR>if she be mated with an equal husband?


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>Three talents on the present; in future, all.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
<BR>To build his fortune I will strain a little,
<BR>For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
<BR>What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
<BR>And make him weigh with her.


<tr valign=top><td>Old Athenian
<td>Most noble lord,
<BR>Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
<BR>The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
<BR>Which is not owed to you!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian]


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
<BR>Go not away. What have you there, my friend?


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>A piece of painting, which I do beseech
<BR>Your lordship to accept.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Painting is welcome.
<BR>The painting is almost the natural man;
<BR>or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
<BR>He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
<BR>Even such as they give out. I like your work;
<BR>And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
<BR>Till you hear further from me.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>The gods preserve ye!


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
<BR>We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
<BR>Hath suffer'd under praise.


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller
<td>What, my lord! dispraise?


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>A more satiety of commendations.
<BR>If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
<BR>It would unclew me quite.


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller
<td>My lord, 'tis rated
<BR>As those which sell would give: but you well know,
<BR>Things of like value differing in the owners
<BR>Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
<BR>You mend the jewel by the wearing it.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Well mock'd.


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
<BR>Which all men speak with him.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Look, who comes here: will you be chid?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter APEMANTUS]


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller
<td>We'll bear, with your lordship.


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>He'll spare none.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
<BR>When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Are they not Athenians?


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Yes.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Then I repent not.


<tr valign=top><td>Jeweller
<td>You know me, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Thou art proud, Apemantus.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Whither art going?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>That's a deed thou'lt die for.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>The best, for the innocence.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Wrought he not well that painted it?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
<BR>he's but a filthy piece of work.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>You're a dog.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>No; I eat not lords.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>That's a lascivious apprehension.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
<BR>man a doit.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>What dost thou think 'tis worth?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>How now, philosopher!


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Thou liest.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Art not one?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Yes.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Then I lie not.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Art not a poet?


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Yes.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
<BR>hast feigned him a worthy fellow.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>That's not feigned; he is so.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
<BR>labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
<BR>the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>What wouldst do then, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>What, thyself?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Ay.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Wherefore?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
<BR>Art not thou a merchant?


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>Ay, Apemantus.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!


<tr valign=top><td>Merchant
<td>If traffic do it, the gods do it.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger]


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>What trumpet's that?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
<BR>All of companionship.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt some Attendants]

<tr valign=top><td><td>You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
<BR>Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
<BR>Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Most welcome, sir!


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>So, so, there!
<BR>Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
<BR>That there should be small love 'mongst these
<BR>sweet knaves,
<BR>And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
<BR>Into baboon and monkey.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
<BR>Most hungerly on your sight.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Right welcome, sir!
<BR>Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
<BR>In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all except APEMANTUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter two Lords]


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>What time o' day is't, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Time to be honest.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>That time serves still.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>Fare thee well, fare thee well.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>Why, Apemantus?


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
<BR>give thee none.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>Hang thyself!


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
<BR>requests to thy friend.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
<BR>And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
<BR>The very heart of kindness.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
<BR>Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
<BR>Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
<BR>But breeds the giver a return exceeding
<BR>All use of quittance.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord

<BR>That ever govern'd man.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord
<td>Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord

<BR>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
<BR>And call him to long peace.
<BR>He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
<BR>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
<BR>To your free heart, I do return those talents,
<BR>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
<BR>I derived liberty.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>O, by no means,
<BR>Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
<BR>I gave it freely ever; and there's none
<BR>Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
<BR>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
<BR>To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.


<tr valign=top><td>VENTIDIUS
<td>A noble spirit!


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Nay, my lords,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Ceremony was but devised at first
<BR>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
<BR>Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
<BR>But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
<BR>Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
<BR>Than my fortunes to me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They sit]


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord

<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS

<tr valign=top><td>TIMON

<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS

<BR>You shall not make me welcome:
<BR>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
<BR>Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
<BR>They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
<BR>man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
<BR>himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
<BR>he fit for't, indeed.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
<BR>observe; I give thee warning on't.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,
<BR>therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
<BR>prithee, let my meat make thee silent.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS
<td>I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
<BR>ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
<BR>men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
<BR>to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
<BR>and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
<BR>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
<BR>Methinks they should invite them without knives;
<BR>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
<BR>There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
<BR>next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
<BR>breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
<BR>man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
<BR>huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
<BR>Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
<BR>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON

<tr valign=top><td>Second Lord

<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS

<BR>well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
<BR>look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
<BR>be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
<BR>This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
<BR>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.

<tr valign=top><td><td>Apemantus' grace.

<tr valign=top><td><td>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
<BR>I pray for no man but myself:
<BR>Grant I may never prove so fond,
<BR>To trust man on his oath or bond;
<BR>Or a harlot, for her weeping;
<BR>Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
<BR>Or a keeper with my freedom;
<BR>Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
<BR>Amen. So fall to't:

<BR>would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
<BR>some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
<BR>for ever perfect.


<tr valign=top><td>TIMON
<td>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
<BR>themselves have provided that I shall have much help
<BR>from you: how had you been my friends else? why
<BR>have you that charitable title from thousands, did
<BR>not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
<BR>more of you to myself than you can with modesty
<BR>speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
<BR>you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
<BR>friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
<BR>were the most needless creatures living, should we
<BR>ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
<BR>sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
<BR>sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
<BR>myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
<BR>are born to do benefits: and what better or
<BR>properer can we can our own than the riches of our
<BR>friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
<BR>so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
<BR>fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
<BR>Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
<BR>forget their faults, I drink to you.


<tr valign=top><td>APEMANTUS

<BR>When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
<BR>Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
<BR>Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
<BR>To hold your hand more close: I did endure
<BR>Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
<BR>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
<BR>And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
<BR>Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--

<BR>Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,

<BR>To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
<BR>If I would broach the vessels of my love,

<BR>Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I

<TABLE width="100%">

<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
<BR>Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
<BR>Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Senator
<td>Most true; the law shall bruise him.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>Now, captain?


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
<BR>For pity is the virtue of the law,
<BR>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
<BR>It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
<BR>Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
<BR>Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
<BR>To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
<BR>He is a man, setting his fate aside,
<BR>Of comely virtues:
<BR>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
<BR>An honour in him which buys out his fault--
<BR>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
<BR>Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
<BR>He did oppose his foe:
<BR>And with such sober and unnoted passion
<BR>He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
<BR>As if he had but proved an argument.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>You undergo too strict a paradox,
<BR>Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
<BR>Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
<BR>To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
<BR>Upon the head of valour; which indeed
<BR>Is valour misbegot and came into the world
<BR>When sects and factions were newly born:
<BR>He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
<BR>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
<BR>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
<BR>carelessly,
<BR>And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
<BR>To bring it into danger.
<BR>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
<BR>What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>My lord,--


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>You cannot make gross sins look clear:
<BR>To revenge is no valour, but to bear.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
<BR>If I speak like a captain.
<BR>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
<BR>And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
<BR>And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
<BR>Without repugnancy? If there be
<BR>Such valour in the bearing, what make we
<BR>Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
<BR>That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
<BR>And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
<BR>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
<BR>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
<BR>As you are great, be pitifully good:
<BR>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
<BR>To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
<BR>But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
<BR>To be in anger is impiety;
<BR>But who is man that is not angry?
<BR>Weigh but the crime with this.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Senator
<td>You breathe in vain.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>In vain! his service done
<BR>At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
<BR>Were a sufficient briber for his life.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>What's that?


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
<BR>And slain in fight many of your enemies:
<BR>How full of valour did he bear himself
<BR>In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!


<tr valign=top><td>Second Senator
<td>He has made too much plenty with 'em;
<BR>He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
<BR>Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
<BR>If there were no foes, that were enough
<BR>To overcome him: in that beastly fury
<BR>He has been known to commit outrages,
<BR>And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
<BR>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>He dies.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Hard fate! he might have died in war.
<BR>My lords, if not for any parts in him--
<BR>Though his right arm might purchase his own time
<BR>And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
<BR>Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:
<BR>And, for I know your reverend ages love
<BR>Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
<BR>My honours to you, upon his good returns.
<BR>If by this crime he owes the law his life,
<BR>Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
<BR>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
<BR>On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
<BR>He forfeits his own blood that spills another.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
<BR>I do beseech you, know me.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Senator
<td>How!


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Call me to your remembrances.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Senator
<td>What!


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
<BR>It could not else be, I should prove so base,
<BR>To sue, and be denied such common grace:
<BR>My wounds ache at you.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>Do you dare our anger?
<BR>'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
<BR>We banish thee for ever.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Banish me!
<BR>Banish your dotage; banish usury,
<BR>That makes the senate ugly.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
<BR>Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
<BR>our spirit,
<BR>He shall be executed presently.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Senators]


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
<BR>Only in bone, that none may look on you!
<BR>I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
<BR>While they have told their money and let out
<BR>Their coin upon large interest, I myself
<BR>Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
<BR>Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
<BR>Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
<BR>It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
<BR>It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
<BR>That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
<BR>My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
<BR>'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;

<BR>Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,

<BR>The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
<BR>Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
<BR>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
<BR>The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
<BR>The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
<BR>That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
<BR>From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
<BR>The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
<BR>Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
<BR>Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
<BR>All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
<BR>Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
<BR>But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
<BR>I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.

<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
<BR>for true, that he's so full of gold?


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
<BR>Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
<BR>straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
<BR>he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.


<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
<BR>again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
<BR>'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
<BR>supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
<BR>us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
<BR>what they travail for, if it be a just true report
<BR>that goes of his having.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet
<td>What have you now to present unto him?


<tr valign=top><td>Painter

<BR>promise him an excellent piece.


<tr valign=top><td>Poet

<tr valign=top><td>Painter
<td>Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the

<BR>performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
<BR>but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
<BR>deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is

<BR>Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
<BR>Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
<BR>With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
<BR>Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
<BR>But kill not all together.

<BR>Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile

<tr valign=top><td>First Senator

<BR>Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
<BR>So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
<BR>To say thou'lt enter friendly.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Senator
<td>Throw thy glove,
<BR>Or any token of thine honour else,
<BR>That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
<BR>And not as our confusion, all thy powers
<BR>Shall make their harbour in our town, till we

<BR>Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
<BR>Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
<BR>Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
<BR>Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
<BR>With my more noble meaning, not a man
<BR>Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
<BR>Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
<BR>But shall be render'd to your public laws
<BR>At heaviest answer.

<tr valign=top><td>Soldier
<td>My noble general, Timon is dead;
<BR>Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
<BR>And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
<BR>With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
<BR>Interprets for my poor ignorance.


<tr valign=top><td>ALCIBIADES
<td>[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a
<BR>wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
<BR>Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
<BR>caitiffs left!
<BR>Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
<BR>Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
<BR>not here thy gait.'
<BR>These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
<BR>Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
<BR>Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
<BR>droplets which
<BR>From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
<BR>Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
<BR>On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
<BR>Is noble Timon: of whose memory
<BR>Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
<BR>And I will use the olive with my sword,
<BR>Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
<BR>Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
<BR>Let our drums strike.
