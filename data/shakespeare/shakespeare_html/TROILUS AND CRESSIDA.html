<tr valign=top><td><td>PROLOGUE


<tr valign=top><td><td>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
<BR>The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
<BR>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
<BR>Fraught with the ministers and instruments
<BR>Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
<BR>Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
<BR>Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
<BR>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
<BR>The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
<BR>With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.
<BR>To Tenedos they come;
<BR>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
<BR>Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
<BR>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
<BR>Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,
<BR>Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
<BR>And Antenorides, with massy staples
<BR>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
<BR>Sperr up the sons of Troy.
<BR>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
<BR>On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
<BR>Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
<BR>A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
<BR>Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
<BR>In like conditions as our argument,
<BR>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
<BR>Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
<BR>Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
<BR>To what may be digested in a play.
<BR>Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
<BR>Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS]


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
<BR>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
<BR>That find such cruel battle here within?
<BR>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
<BR>Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Will this gear ne'er be mended?


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
<BR>Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
<BR>But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
<BR>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
<BR>Less valiant than the virgin in the night
<BR>And skilless as unpractised infancy.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
<BR>I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
<BR>have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Have I not tarried?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
<BR>the bolting.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Have I not tarried?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Still have I tarried.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
<BR>'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
<BR>heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
<BR>stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
<BR>Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
<BR>At Priam's royal table do I sit;
<BR>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
<BR>So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
<BR>her look, or any woman else.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
<BR>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
<BR>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
<BR>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
<BR>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
<BR>But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
<BR>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
<BR>well, go to--there were no more comparison between
<BR>the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
<BR>would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
<BR>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
<BR>will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
<BR>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
<BR>Reply not in how many fathoms deep
<BR>They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
<BR>In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
<BR>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
<BR>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
<BR>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
<BR>In whose comparison all whites are ink,
<BR>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
<BR>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
<BR>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
<BR>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
<BR>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
<BR>Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
<BR>The knife that made it.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>I speak no more than truth.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Thou dost not speak so much.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
<BR>if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
<BR>not, she has the mends in her own hands.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
<BR>her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
<BR>between, but small thanks for my labour.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
<BR>as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
<BR>fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
<BR>I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Say I she is not fair?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
<BR>stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
<BR>I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
<BR>I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Pandarus,--


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Not I.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Sweet Pandarus,--


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
<BR>found it, and there an end.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit PANDARUS. An alarum]


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
<BR>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
<BR>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
<BR>I cannot fight upon this argument;
<BR>It is too starved a subject for my sword.
<BR>But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
<BR>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
<BR>And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
<BR>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
<BR>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
<BR>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
<BR>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
<BR>Between our Ilium and where she resides,
<BR>Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
<BR>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
<BR>Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum. Enter AENEAS]


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
<BR>For womanish it is to be from thence.
<BR>What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>That Paris is returned home and hurt.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>By whom, AEneas?


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>Troilus, by Menelaus.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
<BR>Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum]


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
<BR>But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>In all swift haste.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Come, go we then together.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER]


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Who were those went by?


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>Queen Hecuba and Helen.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>And whither go they?


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>Up to the eastern tower,
<BR>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
<BR>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
<BR>Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
<BR>He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
<BR>And, like as there were husbandry in war,
<BR>Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
<BR>And to the field goes he; where every flower
<BR>Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
<BR>In Hector's wrath.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>What was his cause of anger?


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
<BR>A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
<BR>They call him Ajax.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Good; and what of him?


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>They say he is a very man per se,
<BR>And stands alone.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
<BR>particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
<BR>churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
<BR>into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
<BR>valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
<BR>discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
<BR>hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
<BR>carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
<BR>cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
<BR>joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
<BR>that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
<BR>or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>But how should this man, that makes
<BR>me smile, make Hector angry?


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
<BR>struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
<BR>ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Who comes here?


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PANDARUS]


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Hector's a gallant man.


<tr valign=top><td>ALEXANDER
<td>As may be in the world, lady.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>What's that? what's that?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
<BR>Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
<BR>were you at Ilium?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>This morning, uncle.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
<BR>armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
<BR>up, was she?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Even so: Hector was stirring early.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>That were we talking of, and of his anger.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Was he angry?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>So he says here.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
<BR>about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
<BR>Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
<BR>heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>What, is he angry too?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>O Jupiter! there's no comparison.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
<BR>man if you see him?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>So he is.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>He is not Hector.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
<BR>himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
<BR>or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
<BR>in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Excuse me.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>He is elder.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Pardon me, pardon me.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
<BR>tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
<BR>have his wit this year.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>He shall not need it, if he have his own.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Nor his qualities.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>No matter.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Nor his beauty.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>'Twould not become him; his own's better.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>You have no judgment, niece: Helen
<BR>herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
<BR>a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
<BR>not brown neither,--


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>No, but brown.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>To say the truth, true and not true.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>She praised his complexion above Paris.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Why, Paris hath colour enough.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>So he has.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
<BR>him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
<BR>having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
<BR>flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
<BR>lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
<BR>a copper nose.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Then she's a merry Greek indeed.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
<BR>day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
<BR>has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
<BR>particulars therein to a total.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
<BR>three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
<BR>and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
<BR>becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>O, he smiles valiantly.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Does he not?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
<BR>loves Troilus,--


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
<BR>prove it so.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
<BR>an addle egg.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
<BR>head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
<BR>his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
<BR>must needs confess,--


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Without the rack.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
<BR>that her eyes ran o'er.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>With mill-stones.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>And Cassandra laughed.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
<BR>her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>And Hector laughed.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>At what was all this laughing?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
<BR>too.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>What was his answer?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
<BR>chin, and one of them is white.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>This is her question.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
<BR>fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
<BR>hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
<BR>'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
<BR>my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
<BR>out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
<BR>and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
<BR>rest so laughed, that it passed.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS

<tr valign=top><td><td>[ANTENOR passes]


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Who's that?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
<BR>and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
<BR>judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
<BR>When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if

<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS

<BR>a countenance! is't not a brave man?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>O, a brave man!


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS

<BR>there be hacks!


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS

<tr valign=top><td><td>[PARIS passes]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[HELENUS passes]

<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
<BR>marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the

<tr valign=top><td><td>[TROILUS passes]


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS

<BR>there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
<BR>prince of chivalry!


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Peace, for shame, peace!


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
<BR>him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
<BR>his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
<BR>and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
<BR>three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
<BR>Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
<BR>he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
<BR>Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
<BR>change, would give an eye to boot.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Here come more.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Forces pass]


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
<BR>porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
<BR>eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
<BR>are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
<BR>rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
<BR>all Greece.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Well, well.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
<BR>you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
<BR>birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
<BR>learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
<BR>and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
<BR>in the pie, for then the man's date's out.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
<BR>lie.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
<BR>defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
<BR>honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
<BR>defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
<BR>thousand watches.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Say one of your watches.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
<BR>chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
<BR>not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
<BR>the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
<BR>past watching.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>You are such another!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Troilus's Boy]


<tr valign=top><td>Boy
<td>Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS

<tr valign=top><td>Boy

<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>To bring, uncle?


<tr valign=top><td>PANDARUS
<td>Ay, a token from Troilus.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>By the same token, you are a bawd.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit PANDARUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
<BR>He offers in another's enterprise;
<BR>But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
<BR>Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
<BR>Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
<BR>Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
<BR>That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
<BR>Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
<BR>That she was never yet that ever knew
<BR>Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
<BR>Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
<BR>Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
<BR>Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
<BR>Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,
<BR>MENELAUS, and others]


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON
<td>Princes,
<BR>What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
<BR>The ample proposition that hope makes
<BR>In all designs begun on earth below
<BR>Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
<BR>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
<BR>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
<BR>Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
<BR>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
<BR>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
<BR>That we come short of our suppose so far
<BR>That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
<BR>Sith every action that hath gone before,
<BR>Whereof we have record, trial did draw
<BR>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
<BR>And that unbodied figure of the thought
<BR>That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
<BR>Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
<BR>And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
<BR>But the protractive trials of great Jove
<BR>To find persistive constancy in men:
<BR>The fineness of which metal is not found
<BR>In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
<BR>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
<BR>The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
<BR>But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
<BR>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
<BR>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
<BR>And what hath mass or matter, by itself
<BR>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR
<td>With due observance of thy godlike seat,
<BR>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
<BR>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
<BR>Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
<BR>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
<BR>Upon her patient breast, making their way
<BR>With those of nobler bulk!
<BR>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
<BR>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
<BR>The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
<BR>Bounding between the two moist elements,
<BR>Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
<BR>Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
<BR>Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
<BR>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
<BR>Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
<BR>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
<BR>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
<BR>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
<BR>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
<BR>And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
<BR>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
<BR>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
<BR>Retorts to chiding fortune.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Agamemnon,
<BR>Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
<BR>Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
<BR>In whom the tempers and the minds of all
<BR>Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
<BR>Besides the applause and approbation To which,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To AGAMEMNON]

<tr valign=top><td><td>most mighty for thy place and sway,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To NESTOR]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
<BR>I give to both your speeches, which were such
<BR>As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
<BR>Should hold up high in brass, and such again
<BR>As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
<BR>Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
<BR>On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
<BR>To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
<BR>Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON
<td>Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
<BR>That matter needless, of importless burden,
<BR>Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
<BR>When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
<BR>We shall hear music, wit and oracle.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
<BR>And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
<BR>But for these instances.
<BR>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
<BR>And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
<BR>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
<BR>When that the general is not like the hive
<BR>To whom the foragers shall all repair,
<BR>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
<BR>The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
<BR>The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
<BR>Observe degree, priority and place,
<BR>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
<BR>Office and custom, in all line of order;
<BR>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
<BR>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
<BR>Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
<BR>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
<BR>And posts, like the commandment of a king,
<BR>Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
<BR>In evil mixture to disorder wander,
<BR>What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
<BR>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
<BR>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
<BR>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
<BR>The unity and married calm of states
<BR>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
<BR>Which is the ladder to all high designs,
<BR>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
<BR>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
<BR>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
<BR>The primogenitive and due of birth,
<BR>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
<BR>But by degree, stand in authentic place?
<BR>Take but degree away, untune that string,
<BR>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
<BR>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
<BR>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
<BR>And make a sop of all this solid globe:
<BR>Strength should be lord of imbecility,
<BR>And the rude son should strike his father dead:
<BR>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
<BR>Between whose endless jar justice resides,
<BR>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
<BR>Then every thing includes itself in power,
<BR>Power into will, will into appetite;
<BR>And appetite, an universal wolf,
<BR>So doubly seconded with will and power,
<BR>Must make perforce an universal prey,
<BR>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
<BR>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
<BR>Follows the choking.
<BR>And this neglection of degree it is
<BR>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
<BR>It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
<BR>By him one step below, he by the next,
<BR>That next by him beneath; so every step,
<BR>Exampled by the first pace that is sick
<BR>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
<BR>Of pale and bloodless emulation:
<BR>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
<BR>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
<BR>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR
<td>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
<BR>The fever whereof all our power is sick.


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON
<td>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
<BR>What is the remedy?


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
<BR>The sinew and the forehand of our host,
<BR>Having his ear full of his airy fame,
<BR>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
<BR>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
<BR>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
<BR>Breaks scurril jests;
<BR>And with ridiculous and awkward action,
<BR>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
<BR>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
<BR>Thy topless deputation he puts on,
<BR>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
<BR>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
<BR>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
<BR>'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
<BR>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
<BR>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
<BR>'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
<BR>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
<BR>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
<BR>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
<BR>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
<BR>Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
<BR>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
<BR>As he being drest to some oration.'
<BR>That's done, as near as the extremest ends
<BR>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
<BR>Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
<BR>'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
<BR>Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
<BR>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
<BR>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
<BR>And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
<BR>Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
<BR>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
<BR>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
<BR>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
<BR>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
<BR>Severals and generals of grace exact,
<BR>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
<BR>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
<BR>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
<BR>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR
<td>And in the imitation of these twain--
<BR>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
<BR>With an imperial voice--many are infect.
<BR>Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
<BR>In such a rein, in full as proud a place
<BR>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
<BR>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
<BR>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
<BR>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
<BR>To match us in comparisons with dirt,
<BR>To weaken and discredit our exposure,
<BR>How rank soever rounded in with danger.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
<BR>Count wisdom as no member of the war,
<BR>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
<BR>But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
<BR>That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
<BR>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
<BR>Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
<BR>Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
<BR>They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
<BR>So that the ram that batters down the wall,
<BR>For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
<BR>They place before his hand that made the engine,
<BR>Or those that with the fineness of their souls
<BR>By reason guide his execution.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR
<td>Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
<BR>Makes many Thetis' sons.

<BR>Which is that god in office, guiding men?
<BR>Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON
<td>This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
<BR>Are ceremonious courtiers.


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
<BR>As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
<BR>But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
<BR>Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
<BR>Jove's accord,
<BR>Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
<BR>Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
<BR>The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
<BR>If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
<BR>But what the repining enemy commends,

<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS

<BR>Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
<BR>And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
<BR>What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.

<BR>A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
<BR>Who in this dull and long-continued truce
<BR>Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,

<BR>If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
<BR>That holds his honour higher than his ease,
<BR>That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
<BR>That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
<BR>That loves his mistress more than in confession,
<BR>With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
<BR>And dare avow her beauty and her worth
<BR>In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
<BR>Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
<BR>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
<BR>He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
<BR>Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
<BR>And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
<BR>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
<BR>To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
<BR>If any come, Hector shall honour him;
<BR>If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
<BR>The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
<BR>The splinter of a lance. Even so much.


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON
<td>This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;

<BR>If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
<BR>That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR
<td>Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
<BR>When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;

<BR>I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
<BR>And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
<BR>And meeting him will tell him that my lady
<BR>Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
<BR>As may be in the world: his youth in flood,

<BR>That can from Hector bring his honour off,
<BR>If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
<BR>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
<BR>For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
<BR>With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
<BR>Our imputation shall be oddly poised
<BR>In this wild action; for the success,
<BR>Although particular, shall give a scantling
<BR>Of good or bad unto the general;
<BR>And in such indexes, although small pricks
<BR>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
<BR>The baby figure of the giant mass
<BR>Of things to come at large. It is supposed
<BR>He that meets Hector issues from our choice
<BR>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
<BR>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
<BR>As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
<BR>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
<BR>What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
<BR>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
<BR>Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
<BR>In no less working than are swords and bows
<BR>Directive by the limbs.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Give pardon to my speech:
<BR>Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
<BR>Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
<BR>And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
<BR>The lustre of the better yet to show,
<BR>Shall show the better. Do not consent
<BR>That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
<BR>For both our honour and our shame in this
<BR>Are dogg'd with two strange followers.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR

<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
<BR>Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
<BR>But he already is too insolent;
<BR>And we were better parch in Afric sun
<BR>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
<BR>Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
<BR>Why then, we did our main opinion crush
<BR>In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
<BR>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
<BR>The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
<BR>Give him allowance for the better man;
<BR>For that will physic the great Myrmidon
<BR>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
<BR>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
<BR>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
<BR>We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
<BR>Yet go we under our opinion still
<BR>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
<BR>Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
<BR>Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.

<BR>As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,

<BR>As far as toucheth my particular,
<BR>Yet, dread Priam,
<BR>There is no lady of more softer bowels,
<BR>More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
<BR>More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
<BR>Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
<BR>Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
<BR>The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
<BR>To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
<BR>Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
<BR>Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
<BR>Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
<BR>If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
<BR>To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
<BR>Had it our name, the value of one ten,
<BR>What merit's in that reason which denies
<BR>The yielding of her up?


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Fie, fie, my brother!

<BR>We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,

<BR>We do not throw in unrespective sieve,

<BR>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:

<BR>Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
<BR>Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
<BR>Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
<BR>Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
<BR>And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.

<BR>Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel

<tr valign=top><td>PARIS
<td>Sir, I propose not merely to myself
<BR>The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
<BR>But I would have the soil of her fair rape
<BR>Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
<BR>What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
<BR>Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
<BR>Now to deliver her possession up
<BR>On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
<BR>That so degenerate a strain as this

<BR>There's not the meanest spirit on our party

<BR>When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
<BR>Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
<BR>Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
<BR>Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
<BR>The world's large spaces cannot parallel.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
<BR>And on the cause and question now in hand
<BR>Have glozed, but superficially: not much
<BR>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
<BR>Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
<BR>The reasons you allege do more conduce
<BR>To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
<BR>Than to make up a free determination
<BR>'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
<BR>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
<BR>Of any true decision. Nature craves
<BR>All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
<BR>What nearer debt in all humanity
<BR>Than wife is to the husband? If this law
<BR>Of nature be corrupted through affection,
<BR>And that great minds, of partial indulgence
<BR>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
<BR>There is a law in each well-order'd nation
<BR>To curb those raging appetites that are
<BR>Most disobedient and refractory.
<BR>If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
<BR>As it is known she is, these moral laws
<BR>Of nature and of nations speak aloud
<BR>To have her back return'd: thus to persist
<BR>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
<BR>But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
<BR>Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
<BR>My spritely brethren, I propend to you
<BR>In resolution to keep Helen still,
<BR>For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
<BR>Upon our joint and several dignities.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS
<td>Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
<BR>Were it not glory that we more affected
<BR>Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
<BR>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
<BR>Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
<BR>She is a theme of honour and renown,
<BR>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
<BR>Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
<BR>And fame in time to come canonize us;
<BR>For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
<BR>So rich advantage of a promised glory
<BR>As smiles upon the forehead of this action
<BR>For the wide world's revenue.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>I am yours,
<BR>You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
<BR>I have a roisting challenge sent amongst

<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA
<td>Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
<BR>And fell so roundly to a large confession,
<BR>To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,

<BR>Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


<tr valign=top><td>TROILUS

<BR>As, if it can, I will presume in you--
<BR>To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
<BR>To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
<BR>Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
<BR>That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
<BR>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
<BR>That my integrity and truth to you
<BR>Might be affronted with the match and weight
<BR>Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
<BR>How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
<BR>I am as true as truth's simplicity
<BR>And simpler than the infancy of truth.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<BR>When right with right wars who shall be most right!
<BR>True swains in love shall in the world to come
<BR>Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,

<BR>Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
<BR>As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
<BR>As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,

<BR>Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
<BR>As truth's authentic author to be cited,
<BR>'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
<BR>And sanctify the numbers.

<BR>When time is old and hath forgot itself,
<BR>When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,

<BR>And mighty states characterless are grated
<BR>To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
<BR>From false to false, among false maids in love,

<BR>I do beseech you, as in way of taste,

<BR>Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
<BR>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,

<BR>That their negotiations all must slack,

<tr valign=top><td>PATROCLUS

<BR>To come as humbly as they used to creep
<BR>To holy altars.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>What, am I poor of late?
<BR>'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
<BR>Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
<BR>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
<BR>As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
<BR>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
<BR>And not a man, for being simply man,
<BR>Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
<BR>That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
<BR>Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
<BR>Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
<BR>The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
<BR>Do one pluck down another and together
<BR>Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
<BR>Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
<BR>At ample point all that I did possess,
<BR>Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
<BR>Something not worth in me such rich beholding
<BR>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
<BR>I'll interrupt his reading.
<BR>How now Ulysses!


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Now, great Thetis' son!


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>What are you reading?


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>A strange fellow here
<BR>Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
<BR>How much in having, or without or in,
<BR>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
<BR>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
<BR>As when his virtues shining upon others
<BR>Heat them and they retort that heat again
<BR>To the first giver.'


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>This is not strange, Ulysses.
<BR>The beauty that is borne here in the face
<BR>The bearer knows not, but commends itself
<BR>To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
<BR>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
<BR>Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
<BR>Salutes each other with each other's form;
<BR>For speculation turns not to itself,
<BR>Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
<BR>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>I do not strain at the position,--
<BR>It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
<BR>Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
<BR>That no man is the lord of any thing,
<BR>Though in and of him there be much consisting,
<BR>Till he communicate his parts to others:
<BR>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
<BR>Till he behold them form'd in the applause
<BR>Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
<BR>reverberates
<BR>The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
<BR>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
<BR>His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;
<BR>And apprehended here immediately
<BR>The unknown Ajax.
<BR>Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
<BR>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
<BR>Most abject in regard and dear in use!
<BR>What things again most dear in the esteem
<BR>And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
<BR>An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
<BR>Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
<BR>While some men leave to do!
<BR>How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
<BR>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
<BR>How one man eats into another's pride,
<BR>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
<BR>To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
<BR>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
<BR>As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
<BR>And great Troy shrieking.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
<BR>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
<BR>Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
<BR>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
<BR>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
<BR>Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
<BR>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
<BR>As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
<BR>Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
<BR>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
<BR>In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
<BR>For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
<BR>Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
<BR>For emulation hath a thousand sons
<BR>That one by one pursue: if you give way,
<BR>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
<BR>Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
<BR>And leave you hindmost;
<BR>Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
<BR>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
<BR>O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
<BR>Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
<BR>For time is like a fashionable host
<BR>That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
<BR>And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
<BR>Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
<BR>And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
<BR>virtue seek
<BR>Remuneration for the thing it was;
<BR>For beauty, wit,
<BR>High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
<BR>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
<BR>To envious and calumniating time.
<BR>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
<BR>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
<BR>Though they are made and moulded of things past,
<BR>And give to dust that is a little gilt
<BR>More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
<BR>The present eye praises the present object.
<BR>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
<BR>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
<BR>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
<BR>Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
<BR>And still it might, and yet it may again,
<BR>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
<BR>And case thy reputation in thy tent;
<BR>Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
<BR>Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
<BR>And drave great Mars to faction.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>Of this my privacy
<BR>I have strong reasons.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>But 'gainst your privacy
<BR>The reasons are more potent and heroical:
<BR>'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
<BR>With one of Priam's daughters.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>Ha! known!


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Is that a wonder?
<BR>The providence that's in a watchful state
<BR>Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
<BR>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
<BR>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
<BR>Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
<BR>There is a mystery--with whom relation
<BR>Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
<BR>Which hath an operation more divine
<BR>Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
<BR>All the commerce that you have had with Troy
<BR>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
<BR>And better would it fit Achilles much
<BR>To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
<BR>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
<BR>When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
<BR>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
<BR>'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
<BR>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
<BR>Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
<BR>The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.

<tr valign=top><td>PATROCLUS
<td>To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
<BR>A woman impudent and mannish grown
<BR>Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
<BR>In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
<BR>They think my little stomach to the war
<BR>And your great love to me restrains you thus:
<BR>Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
<BR>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
<BR>And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
<BR>Be shook to air.

<tr valign=top><td>PATROCLUS

<BR>Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
<BR>Omission to do what is necessary
<BR>Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
<BR>And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
<BR>Even then when we sit idly in the sun.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES

<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES

<tr valign=top><td>THERSITES
<td>He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
<BR>prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
<BR>raves in saying nothing.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>How can that be?


<tr valign=top><td>THERSITES
<td>Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
<BR>and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
<BR>arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
<BR>bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
<BR>say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
<BR>and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
<BR>in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
<BR>The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
<BR>neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
<BR>vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
<BR>Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
<BR>you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
<BR>grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
<BR>A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both

<tr valign=top><td>THERSITES
<td>Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
<BR>answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his

<td>You're an odd man; give even or give none.


<tr valign=top><td>MENELAUS
<td>An odd man, lady! every man is odd.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<BR>That you are odd, and he is even with you.


<tr valign=top><td>MENELAUS
<td>You fillip me o' the head.


<tr valign=top><td>CRESSIDA

<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
<BR>To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
<BR>A victor shall be known? will you the knights
<BR>Shall to the edge of all extremity
<BR>Pursue each other, or shall be divided
<BR>By any voice or order of the field?
<BR>Hector bade ask.


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON

<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS

<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
<BR>A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
<BR>The knight opposed.


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>If not Achilles, sir,
<BR>What is your name?


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>If not Achilles, nothing.


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
<BR>In the extremity of great and little,
<BR>Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
<BR>The one almost as infinite as all,
<BR>The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
<BR>And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
<BR>This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
<BR>In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
<BR>Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
<BR>This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter DIOMEDES]


<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON

<BR>Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
<BR>Consent upon the order of their fight,
<BR>So be it; either to the uttermost,
<BR>Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
<BR>Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists]


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES

<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON
<td>What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
<BR>Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
<BR>Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
<BR>Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
<BR>His heart and hand both open and both free;
<BR>For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
<BR>Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
<BR>Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
<BR>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
<BR>For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
<BR>To tender objects, but he in heat of action
<BR>Is more vindicative than jealous love:
<BR>They call him Troilus, and on him erect
<BR>A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
<BR>Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
<BR>Even to his inches, and with private soul
<BR>Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight]

<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>Why, then will I no more:
<BR>Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
<BR>A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
<BR>The obligation of our blood forbids
<BR>A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
<BR>Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
<BR>That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
<BR>And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
<BR>All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
<BR>Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
<BR>Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
<BR>Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
<BR>Wherein my sword had not impressure made
<BR>Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
<BR>That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
<BR>My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
<BR>Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
<BR>By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
<BR>Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
<BR>Cousin, all honour to thee!


<tr valign=top><td>AJAX
<td>I thank thee, Hector
<BR>Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
<BR>I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
<BR>A great addition earned in thy death.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
<BR>On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
<BR>Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
<BR>A thought of added honour torn from Hector.


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>There is expectance here from both the sides,
<BR>What further you will do.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR

<BR>The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.


<tr valign=top><td>AJAX

<BR>As seld I have the chance--I would desire
<BR>My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.


<tr valign=top><td>DIOMEDES

<BR>Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
<BR>And signify this loving interview
<BR>To the expecters of our Trojan part;
<BR>Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
<BR>I will go eat with thee and see your knights.

<tr valign=top><td>AGAMEMNON

<BR>That would be rid of such an enemy;
<BR>But that's no welcome: understand more clear,

<BR>And formless ruin of oblivion;
<BR>But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
<BR>Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,

<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR

<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>The noble Menelaus.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
<BR>Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
<BR>Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
<BR>She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.


<tr valign=top><td>MENELAUS
<td>Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>O, pardon; I offend.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR
<td>I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
<BR>Labouring for destiny make cruel way
<BR>Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
<BR>As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
<BR>Despising many forfeits and subduements,
<BR>When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
<BR>Not letting it decline on the declined,
<BR>That I have said to some my standers by
<BR>'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
<BR>And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
<BR>When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
<BR>Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
<BR>But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
<BR>I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
<BR>And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
<BR>But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
<BR>Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
<BR>And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.


<tr valign=top><td>AENEAS
<td>'Tis the old Nestor.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
<BR>That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
<BR>Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.


<tr valign=top><td>NESTOR

<BR>Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES

<BR>When we have here her base and pillar by us.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
<BR>Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
<BR>Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
<BR>In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
<BR>My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
<BR>For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
<BR>Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
<BR>Must kiss their own feet.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>I must not believe you:
<BR>There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
<BR>The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
<BR>A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
<BR>And that old common arbitrator, Time,
<BR>Will one day end it.


<tr valign=top><td>ULYSSES
<td>So to him we leave it.

<BR>After the general, I beseech you next
<BR>To feast with me and see me at my tent.


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES

<BR>Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
<BR>I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
<BR>And quoted joint by joint.

<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR

<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
<BR>As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
<BR>But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
<BR>Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES
<td>Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
<BR>Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
<BR>That I may give the local wound a name
<BR>And make distinct the very breach whereout
<BR>Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
<td>It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
<BR>To answer such a question: stand again:
<BR>Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
<BR>As to prenominate in nice conjecture
<BR>Where thou wilt hit me dead?


<tr valign=top><td>ACHILLES

<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR

<BR>I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;

<BR>I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
<BR>You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
<BR>His insolence draws folly from my lips;
<BR>But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
<BR>Or may I never--


<tr valign=top><td>AJAX
<td>Do not chafe thee, cousin:
<BR>And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
<BR>Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
<BR>You may have every day enough of Hector
<BR>If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
<BR>Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.


<tr valign=top><td>HECTOR
