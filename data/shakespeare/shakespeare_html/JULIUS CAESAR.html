<BR>Upon a labouring day without the sign

<tr valign=top><td>First Commoner
<td>Why, sir, a carpenter.


<tr valign=top><td>MARULLUS
<td>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
<BR>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
<BR>You, sir, what trade are you?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Commoner
<td>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
<BR>as you would say, a cobbler.


<tr valign=top><td>MARULLUS
<td>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Commoner
<td>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
<BR>conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.


<tr valign=top><td>MARULLUS
<td>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Commoner
<td>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
<BR>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.


<tr valign=top><td>MARULLUS
<td>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!


<tr valign=top><td>Second Commoner
<td>Why, sir, cobble you.


<tr valign=top><td>FLAVIUS
<td>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Commoner
<td>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
<BR>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
<BR>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
<BR>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
<BR>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
<BR>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.


<tr valign=top><td>FLAVIUS
<td>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
<BR>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?


<tr valign=top><td>Second Commoner
<td>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
<BR>into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
<BR>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.


<tr valign=top><td>MARULLUS
<td>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
<BR>What tributaries follow him to Rome,
<BR>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
<BR>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
<BR>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
<BR>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
<BR>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
<BR>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
<BR>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
<BR>The livelong day, with patient expectation,
<BR>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
<BR>And when you saw his chariot but appear,
<BR>Have you not made an universal shout,
<BR>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
<BR>To hear the replication of your sounds
<BR>Made in her concave shores?
<BR>And do you now put on your best attire?
<BR>And do you now cull out a holiday?
<BR>And do you now strew flowers in his way
<BR>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
<BR>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
<BR>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
<BR>That needs must light on this ingratitude.


<tr valign=top><td>FLAVIUS
<td>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
<BR>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
<BR>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
<BR>Into the channel, till the lowest stream
<BR>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all the Commoners]

<BR>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
<BR>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
<BR>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
<BR>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing

<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
<BR>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
<BR>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
<BR>I'll leave you.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
<BR>I have not from your eyes that gentleness
<BR>And show of love as I was wont to have:
<BR>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
<BR>Over your friend that loves you.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Cassius,
<BR>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
<BR>I turn the trouble of my countenance
<BR>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
<BR>Of late with passions of some difference,
<BR>Conceptions only proper to myself,
<BR>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
<BR>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
<BR>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
<BR>Nor construe any further my neglect,
<BR>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
<BR>Forgets the shows of love to other men.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
<BR>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
<BR>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
<BR>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
<BR>But by reflection, by some other things.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>'Tis just:
<BR>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
<BR>That you have no such mirrors as will turn
<BR>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
<BR>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
<BR>Where many of the best respect in Rome,
<BR>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
<BR>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
<BR>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
<BR>That you would have me seek into myself
<BR>For that which is not in me?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
<BR>And since you know you cannot see yourself
<BR>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
<BR>Will modestly discover to yourself
<BR>That of yourself which you yet know not of.
<BR>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
<BR>Were I a common laugher, or did use
<BR>To stale with ordinary oaths my love
<BR>To every new protester; if you know
<BR>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
<BR>And after scandal them, or if you know
<BR>That I profess myself in banqueting
<BR>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish, and shout]


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
<BR>Choose Caesar for their king.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Ay, do you fear it?
<BR>Then must I think you would not have it so.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
<BR>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
<BR>What is it that you would impart to me?
<BR>If it be aught toward the general good,
<BR>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
<BR>And I will look on both indifferently,
<BR>For let the gods so speed me as I love
<BR>The name of honour more than I fear death.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
<BR>As well as I do know your outward favour.
<BR>Well, honour is the subject of my story.
<BR>I cannot tell what you and other men
<BR>Think of this life; but, for my single self,
<BR>I had as lief not be as live to be
<BR>In awe of such a thing as I myself.
<BR>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
<BR>We both have fed as well, and we can both
<BR>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
<BR>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
<BR>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
<BR>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
<BR>Leap in with me into this angry flood,
<BR>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
<BR>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
<BR>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
<BR>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
<BR>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
<BR>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
<BR>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
<BR>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
<BR>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
<BR>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
<BR>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
<BR>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
<BR>Is now become a god, and Cassius is
<BR>A wretched creature and must bend his body,
<BR>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
<BR>He had a fever when he was in Spain,
<BR>And when the fit was on him, I did mark
<BR>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
<BR>His coward lips did from their colour fly,
<BR>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
<BR>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
<BR>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
<BR>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
<BR>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
<BR>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
<BR>A man of such a feeble temper should
<BR>So get the start of the majestic world
<BR>And bear the palm alone.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Shout. Flourish]


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Another general shout!
<BR>I do believe that these applauses are
<BR>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
<BR>Like a Colossus, and we petty men
<BR>Walk under his huge legs and peep about
<BR>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
<BR>Men at some time are masters of their fates:
<BR>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
<BR>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
<BR>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
<BR>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
<BR>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
<BR>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
<BR>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
<BR>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
<BR>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
<BR>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
<BR>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
<BR>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
<BR>When went there by an age, since the great flood,
<BR>But it was famed with more than with one man?
<BR>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
<BR>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
<BR>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
<BR>When there is in it but one only man.
<BR>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
<BR>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
<BR>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
<BR>As easily as a king.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
<BR>What you would work me to, I have some aim:
<BR>How I have thought of this and of these times,
<BR>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
<BR>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
<BR>Be any further moved. What you have said
<BR>I will consider; what you have to say
<BR>I will with patience hear, and find a time
<BR>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
<BR>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
<BR>Brutus had rather be a villager
<BR>Than to repute himself a son of Rome
<BR>Under these hard conditions as this time
<BR>Is like to lay upon us.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>I am glad that my weak words
<BR>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>The games are done and Caesar is returning.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
<BR>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
<BR>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter CAESAR and his Train]


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
<BR>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
<BR>And all the rest look like a chidden train:
<BR>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
<BR>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
<BR>As we have seen him in the Capitol,
<BR>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Casca will tell us what the matter is.


<tr valign=top><td>CAESAR
<td>Antonius!


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONY
<td>Caesar?


<tr valign=top><td>CAESAR
<td>Let me have men about me that are fat;
<BR>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
<BR>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
<BR>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONY
<td>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
<BR>He is a noble Roman and well given.


<tr valign=top><td>CAESAR
<td>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
<BR>Yet if my name were liable to fear,
<BR>I do not know the man I should avoid
<BR>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
<BR>He is a great observer and he looks
<BR>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
<BR>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
<BR>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
<BR>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
<BR>That could be moved to smile at any thing.
<BR>Such men as he be never at heart's ease
<BR>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
<BR>And therefore are they very dangerous.
<BR>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
<BR>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
<BR>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
<BR>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA]


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
<BR>That Caesar looks so sad.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Why, you were with him, were you not?


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
<BR>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
<BR>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>What was the second noise for?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Why, for that too.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Why, for that too.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Was the crown offered him thrice?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
<BR>time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
<BR>mine honest neighbours shouted.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Who offered him the crown?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Why, Antony.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
<BR>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
<BR>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
<BR>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
<BR>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
<BR>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
<BR>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
<BR>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
<BR>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
<BR>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
<BR>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
<BR>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
<BR>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
<BR>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
<BR>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
<BR>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
<BR>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
<BR>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
<BR>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
<BR>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
<BR>displeased them, as they use to do the players in
<BR>the theatre, I am no true man.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>What said he when he came unto himself?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
<BR>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
<BR>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
<BR>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
<BR>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
<BR>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
<BR>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
<BR>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
<BR>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
<BR>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
<BR>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
<BR>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
<BR>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Ay.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Did Cicero say any thing?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Ay, he spoke Greek.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>To what effect?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
<BR>face again: but those that understood him smiled at
<BR>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
<BR>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
<BR>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
<BR>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
<BR>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
<BR>remember it.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>No, I am promised forth.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Will you dine with me to-morrow?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
<BR>worth the eating.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Good: I will expect you.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Do so. Farewell, both.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
<BR>He was quick mettle when he went to school.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>So is he now in execution
<BR>Of any bold or noble enterprise,
<BR>However he puts on this tardy form.
<BR>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
<BR>Which gives men stomach to digest his words
<BR>With better appetite.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
<BR>To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
<BR>I will come home to you; or, if you will,
<BR>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>I will do so: till then, think of the world.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit BRUTUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
<BR>Thy honourable metal may be wrought
<BR>From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
<BR>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
<BR>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
<BR>Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
<BR>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
<BR>He should not humour me. I will this night,
<BR>In several hands, in at his windows throw,
<BR>As if they came from several citizens,
<BR>Writings all tending to the great opinion
<BR>That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
<BR>Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
<BR>And after this let Caesar seat him sure;

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,
<BR>CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO]


<tr valign=top><td>CICERO
<td>Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
<BR>Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
<BR>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
<BR>I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
<BR>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
<BR>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
<BR>To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
<BR>But never till to-night, never till now,
<BR>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
<BR>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
<BR>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
<BR>Incenses them to send destruction.


<tr valign=top><td>CICERO
<td>Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>A common slave--you know him well by sight--
<BR>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
<BR>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
<BR>Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
<BR>Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
<BR>Against the Capitol I met a lion,
<BR>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
<BR>Without annoying me: and there were drawn
<BR>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
<BR>Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
<BR>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
<BR>And yesterday the bird of night did sit
<BR>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
<BR>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
<BR>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
<BR>'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
<BR>For, I believe, they are portentous things
<BR>Unto the climate that they point upon.


<tr valign=top><td>CICERO
<td>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
<BR>But men may construe things after their fashion,
<BR>Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
<BR>Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>He doth; for he did bid Antonius
<BR>Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.


<tr valign=top><td>CICERO
<td>Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
<BR>Is not to walk in.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Farewell, Cicero.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit CICERO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CASSIUS]


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Who's there?


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>A Roman.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Casca, by your voice.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>A very pleasing night to honest men.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
<BR>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
<BR>Submitting me unto the perilous night,
<BR>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
<BR>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
<BR>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
<BR>The breast of heaven, I did present myself
<BR>Even in the aim and very flash of it.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
<BR>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
<BR>When the most mighty gods by tokens send
<BR>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
<BR>That should be in a Roman you do want,
<BR>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
<BR>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
<BR>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
<BR>But if you would consider the true cause
<BR>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
<BR>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
<BR>Why old men fool and children calculate,
<BR>Why all these things change from their ordinance
<BR>Their natures and preformed faculties
<BR>To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
<BR>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
<BR>To make them instruments of fear and warning
<BR>Unto some monstrous state.
<BR>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
<BR>Most like this dreadful night,
<BR>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
<BR>As doth the lion in the Capitol,
<BR>A man no mightier than thyself or me
<BR>In personal action, yet prodigious grown
<BR>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Let it be who it is: for Romans now
<BR>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
<BR>But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
<BR>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
<BR>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
<BR>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
<BR>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
<BR>In every place, save here in Italy.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>I know where I will wear this dagger then;
<BR>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
<BR>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
<BR>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
<BR>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
<BR>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
<BR>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
<BR>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
<BR>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
<BR>If I know this, know all the world besides,
<BR>That part of tyranny that I do bear
<BR>I can shake off at pleasure.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Thunder still]


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>So can I:
<BR>So every bondman in his own hand bears
<BR>The power to cancel his captivity.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
<BR>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
<BR>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
<BR>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
<BR>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
<BR>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
<BR>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
<BR>For the base matter to illuminate
<BR>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
<BR>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
<BR>Before a willing bondman; then I know
<BR>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
<BR>And dangers are to me indifferent.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA
<td>You speak to Casca, and to such a man
<BR>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
<BR>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
<BR>And I will set this foot of mine as far
<BR>As who goes farthest.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>There's a bargain made.
<BR>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
<BR>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
<BR>To undergo with me an enterprise
<BR>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
<BR>And I do know, by this, they stay for me
<BR>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
<BR>There is no stir or walking in the streets;
<BR>And the complexion of the element
<BR>In favour's like the work we have in hand,
<BR>Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.


<tr valign=top><td>CASCA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCIUS

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>It must be by his death: and for my part,

<BR>How that might change his nature, there's the question.
<BR>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
<BR>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
<BR>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
<BR>That at his will he may do danger with.
<BR>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
<BR>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
<BR>I have not known when his affections sway'd
<BR>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
<BR>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
<BR>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
<BR>But when he once attains the upmost round.
<BR>He then unto the ladder turns his back,
<BR>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
<BR>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
<BR>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
<BR>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
<BR>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
<BR>Would run to these and these extremities:

<BR>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
<BR>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
<BR>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
<BR>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
<BR>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
<BR>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
<BR>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
<BR>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
<BR>Our purpose necessary and not envious:
<BR>Which so appearing to the common eyes,
<BR>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.

<BR>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

<BR>Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
<BR>Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
<BR>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
<BR>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
<BR>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
<BR>Either a coward or a flatterer.
<BR>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
<BR>If then thy spirit look upon us now,
<BR>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
<BR>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
<BR>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
<BR>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
<BR>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
<BR>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
<BR>It would become me better than to close
<BR>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
<BR>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
<BR>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
<BR>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
<BR>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;

<BR>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
<BR>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
<BR>was no less than his. If then that friend demand
<BR>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
<BR>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
<BR>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
<BR>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
<BR>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
<BR>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
<BR>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
<BR>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
<BR>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
<BR>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
<BR>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
<BR>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
<BR>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
<BR>vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
<BR>for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

<BR>The evil that men do lives after them;
<BR>The good is oft interred with their bones;
<BR>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
<BR>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
<BR>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
<BR>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
<BR>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
<BR>For Brutus is an honourable man;
<BR>So are they all, all honourable men--
<BR>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
<BR>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
<BR>But Brutus says he was ambitious;
<BR>And Brutus is an honourable man.
<BR>He hath brought many captives home to Rome
<BR>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
<BR>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
<BR>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
<BR>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
<BR>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
<BR>And Brutus is an honourable man.
<BR>You all did see that on the Lupercal
<BR>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
<BR>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
<BR>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
<BR>And, sure, he is an honourable man.
<BR>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
<BR>But here I am to speak what I do know.
<BR>You all did love him once, not without cause:
<BR>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
<BR>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
<BR>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
<BR>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
<BR>And I must pause till it come back to me.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen

<tr valign=top><td>Third Citizen
<td>Has he, masters?
<BR>I fear there will a worse come in his place.


<tr valign=top><td>Fourth Citizen
<td>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
<BR>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.


<tr valign=top><td>First Citizen

<tr valign=top><td>Second Citizen
<td>Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.


<tr valign=top><td>Third Citizen
<td>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.


<tr valign=top><td>Fourth Citizen
<td>Now mark him, he begins again to speak.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONY
<td>But yesterday the word of Caesar might
<BR>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
<BR>And none so poor to do him reverence.
<BR>O masters, if I were disposed to stir
<BR>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
<BR>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
<BR>Who, you all know, are honourable men:
<BR>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
<BR>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
<BR>Than I will wrong such honourable men.
<BR>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
<BR>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
<BR>Let but the commons hear this testament--
<BR>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
<BR>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
<BR>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
<BR>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
<BR>And, dying, mention it within their wills,
<BR>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
<BR>Unto their issue.


<tr valign=top><td>Fourth Citizen

<BR>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
<BR>And let me show you him that made the will.
<BR>Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?

<BR>You all do know this mantle: I remember

<BR>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
<BR>See what a rent the envious Casca made:
<BR>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
<BR>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
<BR>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
<BR>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
<BR>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
<BR>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
<BR>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
<BR>This was the most unkindest cut of all;
<BR>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
<BR>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
<BR>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
<BR>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
<BR>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
<BR>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
<BR>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
<BR>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
<BR>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
<BR>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
<BR>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.

<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
<BR>The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
<BR>Do stand but in a forced affection;
<BR>For they have grudged us contribution:
<BR>The enemy, marching along by them,
<BR>By them shall make a fuller number up,
<BR>Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
<BR>From which advantage shall we cut him off,
<BR>If at Philippi we do face him there,
<BR>These people at our back.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Hear me, good brother.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<BR>That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
<BR>Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
<BR>The enemy increaseth every day;
<BR>We, at the height, are ready to decline.
<BR>There is a tide in the affairs of men,
<BR>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
<BR>Omitted, all the voyage of their life
<BR>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Messala,
<BR>This is my birth-day; as this very day
<BR>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
<BR>Be thou my witness that against my will,
<BR>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
<BR>Upon one battle all our liberties.
<BR>You know that I held Epicurus strong
<BR>And his opinion: now I change my mind,
<BR>And partly credit things that do presage.
<BR>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
<BR>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
<BR>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
<BR>Who to Philippi here consorted us:
<BR>This morning are they fled away and gone;
<BR>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
<BR>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
<BR>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
<BR>A canopy most fatal, under which
<BR>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.


<tr valign=top><td>MESSALA
<td>Believe not so.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>I but believe it partly;
<BR>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
<BR>To meet all perils very constantly.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Even so, Lucilius.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Now, most noble Brutus,
<BR>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
<BR>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
<BR>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
<BR>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
<BR>If we do lose this battle, then is this
<BR>The very last time we shall speak together:
<BR>What are you then determined to do?


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Even by the rule of that philosophy
<BR>By which I did blame Cato for the death
<BR>Which he did give himself, I know not how,
<BR>But I do find it cowardly and vile,
<BR>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
<BR>The time of life: arming myself with patience
<BR>To stay the providence of some high powers
<BR>That govern us below.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>Then, if we lose this battle,
<BR>You are contented to be led in triumph
<BR>Thorough the streets of Rome?


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
<BR>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
<BR>He bears too great a mind. But this same day
<BR>Must end that work the ides of March begun;
<BR>And whether we shall meet again I know not.
<BR>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
<BR>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
<BR>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
<BR>If not, why then, this parting was well made.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIUS
<td>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
<BR>If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
<BR>If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
<BR>The end of this day's business ere it come!
<BR>But it sufficeth that the day will end,
<BR>And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

<BR>I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
<BR>Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
<BR>His funerals shall not be in our camp,
<BR>Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
<BR>And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
<BR>Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
<BR>'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
<BR>We shall try fortune in a second fight.

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<tr valign=top><td>CATO
<td>What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
<BR>I will proclaim my name about the field:
<BR>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
<BR>A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
<BR>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<BR>Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
<BR>Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
<BR>And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.


<tr valign=top><td>First Soldier
<td>Yield, or thou diest.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>Only I yield to die:
<BR>There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;

<tr valign=top><td><td>Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.


<tr valign=top><td>First Soldier

<tr valign=top><td>Second Soldier

<tr valign=top><td>First Soldier

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ANTONY]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONY

<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
<BR>I dare assure thee that no enemy
<BR>Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
<BR>The gods defend him from so great a shame!
<BR>When you do find him, or alive or dead,
<BR>He will be found like Brutus, like himself.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONY
<td>This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
<BR>A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
<BR>Give him all kindness: I had rather have

<BR>VOLUMNIUS]


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
<BR>He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Whispers]


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Peace then! no words.


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>I'll rather kill myself.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Hark thee, Dardanius.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Whispers]


<tr valign=top><td>DARDANIUS

<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS

<tr valign=top><td>DARDANIUS
<td>O Clitus!


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>What ill request did Brutus make to thee?


<tr valign=top><td>DARDANIUS
<td>To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
<BR>That it runs over even at his eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.


<tr valign=top><td>VOLUMNIUS
<td>What says my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Why, this, Volumnius:
<BR>The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
<BR>Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
<BR>And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
<BR>I know my hour is come.


<tr valign=top><td>VOLUMNIUS
<td>Not so, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
<BR>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
<BR>Our enemies have beat us to the pit:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Low alarums]

<tr valign=top><td><td>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
<BR>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
<BR>Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
<BR>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
<BR>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.


<tr valign=top><td>VOLUMNIUS
<td>That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum still]


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
<BR>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
<BR>Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
<BR>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
<BR>I found no man but he was true to me.
<BR>I shall have glory by this losing day
<BR>More than Octavius and Mark Antony
<BR>By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
<BR>So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
<BR>Hath almost ended his life's history:
<BR>Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
<BR>That have but labour'd to attain this hour.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!']


<tr valign=top><td>CLITUS
<td>Fly, my lord, fly.


<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS
<td>Hence! I will follow.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
<BR>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
<BR>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
<BR>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
<BR>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?


<tr valign=top><td>STRATO

<tr valign=top><td>BRUTUS

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,
<BR>LUCILIUS, and the army]


<tr valign=top><td>OCTAVIUS
<td>What man is that?


<tr valign=top><td>MESSALA
<td>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?


<tr valign=top><td>STRATO
<td>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
<BR>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
<BR>For Brutus only overcame himself,
<BR>And no man else hath honour by his death.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCILIUS
<td>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
<BR>That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.


<tr valign=top><td>OCTAVIUS
<td>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
<BR>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?


<tr valign=top><td>STRATO
<td>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.


<tr valign=top><td>OCTAVIUS
<td>Do so, good Messala.


<tr valign=top><td>MESSALA
<td>How died my master, Strato?


<tr valign=top><td>STRATO
<td>I held the sword, and he did run on it.


<tr valign=top><td>MESSALA
<td>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
<BR>That did the latest service to my master.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONY
<td>This was the noblest Roman of them all:
<BR>All the conspirators save only he
<BR>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
<BR>He only, in a general honest thought
<BR>And common good to all, made one of them.
<BR>His life was gentle, and the elements
<BR>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
<BR>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'


<tr valign=top><td>OCTAVIUS
<td>According to his virtue let us use him,
<BR>With all respect and rites of burial.
<BR>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
<BR>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
<BR>So call the field to rest; and let's away,
<BR>To part the glories of this happy day.
