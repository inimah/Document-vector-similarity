<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS]


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
<BR>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
<BR>Were't not affection chains thy tender days
<BR>To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
<BR>I rather would entreat thy company
<BR>To see the wonders of the world abroad,
<BR>Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
<BR>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
<BR>But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
<BR>Even as I would when I to love begin.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
<BR>Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
<BR>Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
<BR>Wish me partaker in thy happiness
<BR>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
<BR>If ever danger do environ thee,
<BR>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
<BR>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>And on a love-book pray for my success?


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>That's on some shallow story of deep love:
<BR>How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>That's a deep story of a deeper love:
<BR>For he was more than over shoes in love.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
<BR>And yet you never swum the Hellespont.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>No, I will not, for it boots thee not.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>What?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
<BR>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
<BR>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
<BR>If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
<BR>If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
<BR>However, but a folly bought with wit,
<BR>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Love is your master, for he masters you:
<BR>And he that is so yoked by a fool,
<BR>Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
<BR>The eating canker dwells, so eating love
<BR>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>And writers say, as the most forward bud
<BR>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
<BR>Even so by love the young and tender wit
<BR>Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
<BR>Losing his verdure even in the prime
<BR>And all the fair effects of future hopes.
<BR>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
<BR>That art a votary to fond desire?
<BR>Once more adieu! my father at the road
<BR>Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
<BR>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
<BR>Of thy success in love, and what news else
<BR>Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
<BR>And likewise will visit thee with mine.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>As much to you at home! and so, farewell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>He after honour hunts, I after love:
<BR>He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
<BR>I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
<BR>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
<BR>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
<BR>War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
<BR>Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter SPEED]


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
<BR>And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
<BR>An if the shepherd be a while away.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
<BR>and I a sheep?


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>I do.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>This proves me still a sheep.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>True; and thy master a shepherd.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
<BR>shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
<BR>not me: therefore I am no sheep.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
<BR>shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
<BR>wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
<BR>follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
<BR>a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
<BR>lost mutton, nothing for my labour.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
<BR>carrying your letter.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
<BR>'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
<BR>your lover.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>But what said she?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>[First nodding]  Ay.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
<BR>me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>And that set together is noddy.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
<BR>take it for your pains.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Why sir, how do you bear with me?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
<BR>but the word 'noddy' for my pains.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
<BR>be both at once delivered.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
<BR>not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
<BR>and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
<BR>fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
<BR>mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
<BR>hard as steel.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>What said she? nothing?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
<BR>testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
<BR>me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
<BR>letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
<BR>Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
<BR>Being destined to a drier death on shore.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit SPEED]

<tr valign=top><td><td>I must go send some better messenger:
<BR>I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
<BR>Receiving them from such a worthless post.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter JULlA and LUCETTA]


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
<BR>Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
<BR>That every day with parle encounter me,
<BR>In thy opinion which is worthiest love?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
<BR>According to my shallow simple skill.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
<BR>But, were I you, he never should be mine.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>How now! what means this passion at his name?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
<BR>That I, unworthy body as I am,
<BR>Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Then thus: of many good I think him best.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Your reason?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>I have no other, but a woman's reason;
<BR>I think him so because I think him so.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>His little speaking shows his love but small.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>They do not love that do not show their love.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>O, they love least that let men know their love.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>I would I knew his mind.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>'To Julia.' Say, from whom?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>That the contents will show.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Say, say, who gave it thee?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
<BR>He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
<BR>Did in your name receive it: pardon the
<BR>fault I pray.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
<BR>Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
<BR>To whisper and conspire against my youth?
<BR>Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
<BR>And you an officer fit for the place.
<BR>Or else return no more into my sight.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Will ye be gone?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>That you may ruminate.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
<BR>It were a shame to call her back again
<BR>And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
<BR>What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
<BR>And would not force the letter to my view!
<BR>Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
<BR>Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
<BR>Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
<BR>That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
<BR>And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
<BR>How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
<BR>When willingly I would have had her here!
<BR>How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
<BR>When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
<BR>My penance is to call Lucetta back
<BR>And ask remission for my folly past.
<BR>What ho! Lucetta!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter LUCETTA]

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<BR>Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Let's see your song. How now, minion!


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>No, madam; it is too sharp.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>You, minion, are too saucy.


<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA
<td>Nay, now you are too flat
<BR>And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
<BR>There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>LUCETTA

<BR>Here is a coil with protestation!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Tears the letter]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<BR>O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
<BR>Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
<BR>And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
<BR>I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
<BR>Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
<BR>As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
<BR>I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
<BR>Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
<BR>And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
<BR>Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
<BR>Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
<BR>And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
<BR>But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
<BR>Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
<BR>Till I have found each letter in the letter,
<BR>Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
<BR>Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
<BR>And throw it thence into the raging sea!
<BR>Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
<BR>'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
<BR>To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that

<tr valign=top><td>PANTHINO

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Why, what of him?


<tr valign=top><td>PANTHINO
<td>He wonder'd that your lordship
<BR>Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,

<BR>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
<BR>Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
<BR>Some to discover islands far away;
<BR>Some to the studious universities.
<BR>For any or for all these exercises,
<BR>He said that Proteus your son was meet,
<BR>And did request me to importune you
<BR>To let him spend his time no more at home,
<BR>Which would be great impeachment to his age,
<BR>In having known no travel in his youth.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
<BR>Whereon this month I have been hammering.
<BR>I have consider'd well his loss of time

<BR>And perfected by the swift course of time.
<BR>Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?

<BR>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
<BR>Ah, Silvia, Silvia!


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>How now, sirrah?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>She is not within hearing, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Why, sir, who bade you call her?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Well, you'll still be too forward.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>She that your worship loves?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Why, how know you that I am in love?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
<BR>learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
<BR>like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
<BR>robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
<BR>the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
<BR>lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
<BR>buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
<BR>diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
<BR>speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
<BR>wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
<BR>walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
<BR>fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
<BR>looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
<BR>are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
<BR>on you, I can hardly think you my master.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Are all these things perceived in me?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>They are all perceived without ye.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Without me? they cannot.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
<BR>were so simple, none else would: but you are so
<BR>without these follies, that these follies are within
<BR>you and shine through you like the water in an
<BR>urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
<BR>physician to comment on your malady.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
<BR>knowest her not?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Is she not hard-favoured, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Sir, I know that well enough.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>What dost thou know?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>That's because the one is painted and the other out
<BR>of all count.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>How painted? and how out of count?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
<BR>man counts of her beauty.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>You never saw her since she was deformed.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>How long hath she been deformed?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Ever since you loved her.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
<BR>see her beautiful.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>If you love her, you cannot see her.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Why?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
<BR>or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
<BR>have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
<BR>ungartered!


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>What should I see then?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
<BR>for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
<BR>hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
<BR>morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
<BR>you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
<BR>bolder to chide you for yours.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>In conclusion, I stand affected to her.

<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.

<td>No, madam; so it stead you, I will write

<td>A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;

<td>[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>What means your ladyship? do you not like it?


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA

<BR>But since unwillingly, take them again.
<BR>Nay, take them.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Madam, they are for you.


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>What figure?


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>By a letter, I should say.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE

<td>No, believe me.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
<BR>her earnest?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>She gave me none, except an angry word.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>Why, she hath given you a letter.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>That's the letter I writ to her friend.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>I would it were no worse.


<tr valign=top><td>SPEED
<td>I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
<BR>For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
<BR>Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
<BR>Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
<BR>Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
<BR>All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
<BR>I have done penance for contemning Love,
<BR>Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
<BR>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
<BR>With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
<BR>For in revenge of my contempt of love,
<BR>Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes

<BR>O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
<BR>And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
<BR>There is no woe to his correction,
<BR>Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
<BR>Now no discourse, except it be of love;
<BR>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,

<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS

<td>No; but she is an earthly paragon.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Call her divine.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>I will not flatter her.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
<BR>And I must minister the like to you.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,

<BR>Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
<BR>And, of so great a favour growing proud,
<BR>Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
<BR>And make rough winter everlastingly.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS

<BR>The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
<BR>Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
<BR>Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
<BR>My foolish rival, that her father likes
<BR>Only for his possessions are so huge,

<BR>The ladder made of cords, and all the means
<BR>Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
<BR>Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
<BR>In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.

<BR>Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
<BR>That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
<BR>She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
<BR>That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
<BR>Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
<BR>Bears no impression of the thing it was.
<BR>Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,

<BR>O, but I love his lady too too much,

<BR>How shall I dote on her with more advice,
<BR>That thus without advice begin to love her!

<BR>My duty pricks me on to utter that
<BR>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
<BR>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
<BR>This night intends to steal away your daughter:
<BR>Myself am one made privy to the plot.
<BR>I know you have determined to bestow her
<BR>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
<BR>And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
<BR>It would be much vexation to your age.
<BR>Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
<BR>To cross my friend in his intended drift
<BR>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
<BR>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
<BR>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
<BR>Which to requite, command me while I live.
<BR>This love of theirs myself have often seen,
<BR>Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
<BR>And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
<BR>Sir Valentine her company and my court:
<BR>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
<BR>And so unworthily disgrace the man,
<BR>A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
<BR>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
<BR>That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
<BR>And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
<BR>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
<BR>I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
<BR>The key whereof myself have ever kept;
<BR>And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

<BR>Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match

<BR>Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
<BR>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
<BR>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
<BR>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
<BR>Neither regarding that she is my child
<BR>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
<BR>And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
<BR>Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;

<BR>Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
<BR>I now am full resolved to take a wife
<BR>And turn her out to who will take her in:

<BR>How and which way I may bestow myself
<BR>To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
<BR>Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
<BR>More than quick words do move a woman's mind.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>But she did scorn a present that I sent her.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
<BR>Send her another; never give her o'er;
<BR>For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
<BR>If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
<BR>But rather to beget more love in you:
<BR>If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
<BR>For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
<BR>Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
<BR>For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
<BR>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
<BR>Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
<BR>That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
<BR>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE

<BR>What might we do to make the girl forget

<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
<BR>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
<BR>By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Then you must undertake to slander him.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS

<td>As much as I can do, I will effect:

<BR>You must lay lime to tangle her desires

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Ay,

<BR>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:

<BR>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
<BR>That may discover such integrity:
<BR>For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,

<tr valign=top><td>LAUNCE
<td>When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
<BR>look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
<BR>puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
<BR>four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
<BR>I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
<BR>'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
<BR>him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
<BR>and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
<BR>steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
<BR>O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
<BR>in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
<BR>one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
<BR>as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
<BR>more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
<BR>I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
<BR>live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
<BR>thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
<BR>gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
<BR>not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
<BR>all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
<BR>one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
<BR>out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
<BR>I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
<BR>knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
<BR>whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
<BR>the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
<BR>the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
<BR>wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
<BR>of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
<BR>his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
<BR>stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
<BR>been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
<BR>he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
<BR>Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
<BR>trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
<BR>Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
<BR>do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
<BR>water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst

<BR>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
<BR>Here is her picture: let me see; I think,

<td>[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.


<tr valign=top><td>THURIO
<td>Considers she my possessions?


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>O, ay; and pities them.


<tr valign=top><td>THURIO
<td>Wherefore?


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>That they are out by lease.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Here comes the duke.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DUKE]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
<BR>Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?


<tr valign=top><td>THURIO
<td>Not I.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Nor I.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Saw you my daughter?


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Neither.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Why then,
<BR>She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
<BR>And Eglamour is in her company.
<BR>'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
<BR>As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
<BR>Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
<BR>But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
<BR>Besides, she did intend confession
<BR>At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
<BR>These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
<BR>Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
<BR>But mount you presently and meet with me
<BR>Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
<BR>That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
<BR>Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>THURIO
<td>Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
<BR>That flies her fortune when it follows her.
<BR>I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
<BR>Than for the love of reckless Silvia.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
<BR>Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>And I will follow, more to cross that love
<BR>Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>How use doth breed a habit in a man!
<BR>This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
<BR>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
<BR>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
<BR>And to the nightingale's complaining notes
<BR>Tune my distresses and record my woes.
<BR>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
<BR>Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
<BR>Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
<BR>And leave no memory of what it was!
<BR>Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
<BR>Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
<BR>What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
<BR>These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
<BR>Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
<BR>They love me well; yet I have much to do
<BR>To keep them from uncivil outrages.
<BR>Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA]


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Madam, this service I have done for you,
<BR>Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
<BR>To hazard life and rescue you from him
<BR>That would have forced your honour and your love;
<BR>Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
<BR>A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
<BR>And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
<BR>Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>O miserable, unhappy that I am!


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
<BR>But by my coming I have made you happy.


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
<BR>I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
<BR>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
<BR>O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
<BR>Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
<BR>And full as much, for more there cannot be,
<BR>I do detest false perjured Proteus.
<BR>Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
<BR>Would I not undergo for one calm look!
<BR>O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
<BR>When women cannot love where they're beloved!


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
<BR>Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
<BR>For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
<BR>Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
<BR>Descended into perjury, to love me.
<BR>Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
<BR>And that's far worse than none; better have none
<BR>Than plural faith which is too much by one:
<BR>Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>In love
<BR>Who respects friend?


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>All men but Proteus.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
<BR>Can no way change you to a milder form,
<BR>I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
<BR>And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIA
<td>O heaven!


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>I'll force thee yield to my desire.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
<BR>Thou friend of an ill fashion!


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Valentine!


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
<BR>For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
<BR>Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
<BR>Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
<BR>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
<BR>Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
<BR>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
<BR>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
<BR>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
<BR>The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
<BR>'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>My shame and guilt confounds me.
<BR>Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
<BR>Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
<BR>I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
<BR>As e'er I did commit.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Then I am paid;
<BR>And once again I do receive thee honest.
<BR>Who by repentance is not satisfied
<BR>Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
<BR>By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
<BR>And, that my love may appear plain and free,
<BR>All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE

<BR>Look up; speak.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
<BR>to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Where is that ring, boy?


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Here 'tis; this is it.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>How! let me see:

<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
<BR>This is the ring you sent to Silvia.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
<BR>I gave this unto Julia.


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>And Julia herself did give it me;
<BR>And Julia herself hath brought it hither.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>How! Julia!


<tr valign=top><td>JULIA
<td>Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
<BR>And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
<BR>How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
<BR>O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
<BR>Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
<BR>Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
<BR>In a disguise of love:
<BR>It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
<BR>Women to change their shapes than men their minds.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS
<td>Than men their minds! 'tis true.
<BR>O heaven! were man
<BR>But constant, he were perfect. That one error
<BR>Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
<BR>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
<BR>What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
<BR>More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Come, come, a hand from either:
<BR>Let me be blest to make this happy close;
<BR>'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.


<tr valign=top><td>PROTEUS

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE

<BR>Come not within the measure of my wrath;
<BR>Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
<BR>Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;

<tr valign=top><td>THURIO

<BR>And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
<BR>Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
<BR>Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
<BR>Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
<BR>To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
<BR>Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
<BR>Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.

<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE

<BR>Forgive them what they have committed here
<BR>And let them be recall'd from their exile:
<BR>They are reformed, civil, full of good
<BR>And fit for great employment, worthy lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:

<BR>Come, let us go: we will include all jars
<BR>With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
<BR>With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
<BR>What think you of this page, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE
<td>What mean you by that saying?


<tr valign=top><td>VALENTINE
<td>Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
<BR>That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
<BR>Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
<BR>The story of your loves discovered:
<BR>That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
<BR>One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
