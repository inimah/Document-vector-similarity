<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter RODERIGO and IAGO]


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
<BR>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
<BR>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
<BR>If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
<BR>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
<BR>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
<BR>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
<BR>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
<BR>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
<BR>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
<BR>And, in conclusion,
<BR>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
<BR>'I have already chose my officer.'
<BR>And what was he?
<BR>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
<BR>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
<BR>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
<BR>That never set a squadron in the field,
<BR>Nor the division of a battle knows
<BR>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
<BR>Wherein the toged consuls can propose
<BR>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
<BR>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
<BR>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
<BR>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
<BR>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
<BR>By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
<BR>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
<BR>And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
<BR>Preferment goes by letter and affection,
<BR>And not by old gradation, where each second
<BR>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
<BR>Whether I in any just term am affined
<BR>To love the Moor.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>I would not follow him then.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>O, sir, content you;
<BR>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
<BR>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
<BR>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
<BR>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
<BR>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
<BR>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
<BR>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
<BR>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
<BR>Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
<BR>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
<BR>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
<BR>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
<BR>their coats
<BR>Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
<BR>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
<BR>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
<BR>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
<BR>In following him, I follow but myself;
<BR>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
<BR>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
<BR>For when my outward action doth demonstrate
<BR>The native act and figure of my heart
<BR>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
<BR>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
<BR>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
<BR>If he can carry't thus!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Call up her father,
<BR>Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
<BR>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
<BR>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
<BR>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
<BR>Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
<BR>As it may lose some colour.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
<BR>As when, by night and negligence, the fire
<BR>Is spied in populous cities.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
<BR>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
<BR>Thieves! thieves!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[BRABANTIO appears above, at a window]


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>What is the reason of this terrible summons?
<BR>What is the matter there?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Signior, is all your family within?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Are your doors lock'd?


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Why, wherefore ask you this?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
<BR>your gown;
<BR>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
<BR>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
<BR>Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
<BR>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
<BR>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
<BR>Arise, I say.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>What, have you lost your wits?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Not I	what are you?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>My name is Roderigo.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>The worser welcome:
<BR>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
<BR>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
<BR>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
<BR>Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
<BR>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
<BR>To start my quiet.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Sir, sir, sir,--


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>But thou must needs be sure
<BR>My spirit and my place have in them power
<BR>To make this bitter to thee.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Patience, good sir.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
<BR>My house is not a grange.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Most grave Brabantio,
<BR>In simple and pure soul I come to you.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
<BR>serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
<BR>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
<BR>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
<BR>you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
<BR>coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>What profane wretch art thou?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
<BR>and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Thou art a villain.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>You are--a senator.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
<BR>If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
<BR>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
<BR>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
<BR>Transported, with no worse nor better guard
<BR>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
<BR>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
<BR>If this be known to you and your allowance,
<BR>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
<BR>But if you know not this, my manners tell me
<BR>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
<BR>That, from the sense of all civility,
<BR>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
<BR>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
<BR>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
<BR>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
<BR>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
<BR>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
<BR>If she be in her chamber or your house,
<BR>Let loose on me the justice of the state
<BR>For thus deluding you.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Strike on the tinder, ho!
<BR>Give me a taper! call up all my people!
<BR>This accident is not unlike my dream:
<BR>Belief of it oppresses me already.
<BR>Light, I say! light!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit above]


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Farewell; for I must leave you:
<BR>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
<BR>To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
<BR>Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
<BR>However this may gall him with some cheque,
<BR>Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
<BR>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
<BR>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
<BR>Another of his fathom they have none,
<BR>To lead their business: in which regard,
<BR>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
<BR>Yet, for necessity of present life,
<BR>I must show out a flag and sign of love,
<BR>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
<BR>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
<BR>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches]


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>It is too true an evil: gone she is;
<BR>And what's to come of my despised time
<BR>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
<BR>Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
<BR>With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
<BR>How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
<BR>Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
<BR>Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Truly, I think they are.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
<BR>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
<BR>By what you see them act. Is there not charms
<BR>By which the property of youth and maidhood
<BR>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
<BR>Of some such thing?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Yes, sir, I have indeed.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
<BR>Some one way, some another. Do you know
<BR>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>I think I can discover him, if you please,
<BR>To get good guard and go along with me.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
<BR>I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
<BR>And raise some special officers of night.
<BR>On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches]


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
<BR>Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
<BR>To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
<BR>Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
<BR>I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>'Tis better as it is.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Nay, but he prated,

<tr valign=top><td><td>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
<BR>Against your honour
<BR>That, with the little godliness I have,
<BR>I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
<BR>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
<BR>That the magnifico is much beloved,
<BR>And hath in his effect a voice potential
<BR>As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
<BR>Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
<BR>The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
<BR>Will give him cable.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Let him do his spite:
<BR>My services which I have done the signiory
<BR>Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
<BR>Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
<BR>I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
<BR>From men of royal siege, and my demerits
<BR>May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
<BR>As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
<BR>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
<BR>I would not my unhoused free condition
<BR>Put into circumscription and confine
<BR>For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO

<BR>And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
<BR>Even on the instant.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>What is the matter, think you?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
<BR>It is a business of some heat: the galleys
<BR>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
<BR>This very night at one another's heels,
<BR>And many of the consuls, raised and met,
<BR>Are at the duke's already: you have been
<BR>hotly call'd for;

<BR>Good signior, you shall more command with years
<BR>Than with your weapons.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
<BR>Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
<BR>For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
<BR>If she in chains of magic were not bound,
<BR>Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
<BR>So opposite to marriage that she shunned
<BR>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
<BR>Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
<BR>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
<BR>Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
<BR>Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
<BR>That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
<BR>Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
<BR>That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
<BR>'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
<BR>I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
<BR>For an abuser of the world, a practiser
<BR>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
<BR>Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE OF VENICE
<td>[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>Nothing, but this is so.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
<BR>My very noble and approved good masters,
<BR>That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
<BR>It is most true; true, I have married her:
<BR>The very head and front of my offending
<BR>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
<BR>And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
<BR>For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
<BR>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
<BR>Their dearest action in the tented field,
<BR>And little of this great world can I speak,
<BR>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
<BR>And therefore little shall I grace my cause
<BR>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
<BR>I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
<BR>Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
<BR>What conjuration and what mighty magic,
<BR>For such proceeding I am charged withal,
<BR>I won his daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>BRABANTIO
<td>A maiden never bold;
<BR>Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
<BR>Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
<BR>Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
<BR>To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
<BR>It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
<BR>That will confess perfection so could err
<BR>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
<BR>To find out practises of cunning hell,
<BR>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
<BR>That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
<BR>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
<BR>He wrought upon her.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE OF VENICE
<td>To vouch this, is no proof,
<BR>Without more wider and more overt test
<BR>Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
<BR>Of modern seeming do prefer against him.


<tr valign=top><td>First Senator
<td>But, Othello, speak:
<BR>Did you by indirect and forced courses
<BR>Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
<BR>Or came it by request and such fair question
<BR>As soul to soul affordeth?


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>I do beseech you,
<BR>Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
<BR>And let her speak of me before her father:
<BR>If you do find me foul in her report,
<BR>The trust, the office I do hold of you,
<BR>Not only take away, but let your sentence
<BR>Even fall upon my life.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE OF VENICE

<BR>I do confess the vices of my blood,
<BR>So justly to your grave ears I'll present
<BR>How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
<BR>And she in mine.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE OF VENICE
<td>Say it, Othello.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Her father loved me; oft invited me;
<BR>Still question'd me the story of my life,
<BR>From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
<BR>That I have passed.
<BR>I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
<BR>To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
<BR>Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
<BR>Of moving accidents by flood and field
<BR>Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
<BR>Of being taken by the insolent foe
<BR>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
<BR>And portance in my travels' history:
<BR>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
<BR>Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
<BR>It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
<BR>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
<BR>The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
<BR>Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
<BR>Would Desdemona seriously incline:
<BR>But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
<BR>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
<BR>She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
<BR>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
<BR>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
<BR>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
<BR>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
<BR>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
<BR>But not intentively: I did consent,
<BR>And often did beguile her of her tears,
<BR>When I did speak of some distressful stroke
<BR>That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
<BR>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
<BR>She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
<BR>'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
<BR>She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
<BR>That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
<BR>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
<BR>I should but teach him how to tell my story.
<BR>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
<BR>She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
<BR>And I loved her that she did pity them.
<BR>This only is the witchcraft I have used:
<BR>Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

<BR>I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE OF VENICE
<td>Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
<BR>Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
<BR>Into your favour.
<BR>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
<BR>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
<BR>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
<BR>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.

<BR>Patience her injury a mockery makes.

<BR>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
<BR>But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
<BR>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
<BR>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
<BR>These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
<BR>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
<BR>But words are words; I never yet did hear
<BR>That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
<BR>or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
<BR>our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
<BR>nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
<BR>thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
<BR>distract it with many, either to have it sterile
<BR>with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
<BR>power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
<BR>wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
<BR>scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
<BR>blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
<BR>to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
<BR>reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
<BR>stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
<BR>you call love to be a sect or scion.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>It cannot be.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
<BR>the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
<BR>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
<BR>friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
<BR>cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
<BR>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
<BR>purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
<BR>an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
<BR>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
<BR>love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
<BR>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
<BR>shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
<BR>money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
<BR>their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
<BR>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
<BR>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
<BR>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
<BR>she will find the error of her choice: she must
<BR>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
<BR>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
<BR>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
<BR>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
<BR>an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
<BR>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
<BR>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
<BR>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
<BR>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
<BR>to be drowned and go without her.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
<BR>the issue?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
<BR>thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
<BR>hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
<BR>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
<BR>against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
<BR>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
<BR>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>In faith, too much;
<BR>I find it still, when I have list to sleep:

<BR>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO

<BR>You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as

<BR>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
<BR>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
<BR>I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
<BR>I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
<BR>In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
<BR>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
<BR>Bring thou the master to the citadel;
<BR>He is a good one, and his worthiness
<BR>Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO

<BR>men being in love have then a nobility in their
<BR>natures more than is native to them--list me. The
<BR>lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
<BR>guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
<BR>directly in love with him.



<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>With him! why, 'tis not possible.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
<BR>Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
<BR>but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
<BR>and will she love him still for prating? let not
<BR>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
<BR>and what delight shall she have to look on the
<BR>devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
<BR>sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
<BR>give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
<BR>sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
<BR>the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
<BR>required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
<BR>find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
<BR>disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
<BR>instruct her in it and compel her to some second
<BR>choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
<BR>pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
<BR>eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
<BR>does? a knave very voluble; no further
<BR>conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
<BR>civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
<BR>of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
<BR>none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
<BR>finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
<BR>counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
<BR>present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
<BR>knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
<BR>requisites in him that folly and green minds look
<BR>after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
<BR>hath found him already.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
<BR>most blessed condition.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
<BR>grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
<BR>have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
<BR>not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
<BR>not mark that?


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
<BR>to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
<BR>so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
<BR>together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
<BR>mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
<BR>the master and main exercise, the incorporate
<BR>conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
<BR>have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
<BR>for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
<BR>you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
<BR>some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
<BR>too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
<BR>other course you please, which the time shall more
<BR>favourably minister.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Well.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
<BR>may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
<BR>even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
<BR>mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
<BR>taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
<BR>shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
<BR>the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
<BR>impediment most profitably removed, without the
<BR>which there were no expectation of our prosperity.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>I will do this, if I can bring it to any
<BR>opportunity.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
<BR>I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Adieu.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
<BR>That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
<BR>The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
<BR>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
<BR>And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
<BR>A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
<BR>Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
<BR>I stand accountant for as great a sin,
<BR>But partly led to diet my revenge,
<BR>For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
<BR>Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
<BR>Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
<BR>And nothing can or shall content my soul
<BR>Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
<BR>Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
<BR>At least into a jealousy so strong
<BR>That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
<BR>If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
<BR>For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
<BR>I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
<BR>Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
<BR>For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
<BR>Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
<BR>For making him egregiously an ass
<BR>And practising upon his peace and quiet
<BR>Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:

<BR>Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
<BR>Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
<BR>From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
<BR>Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
<BR>Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
<BR>In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
<BR>Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
<BR>As if some planet had unwitted men--
<BR>Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
<BR>In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
<BR>Any beginning to this peevish odds;
<BR>And would in action glorious I had lost
<BR>Those legs that brought me to a part of it!


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
<BR>The gravity and stillness of your youth
<BR>The world hath noted, and your name is great
<BR>In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
<BR>That you unlace your reputation thus
<BR>And spend your rich opinion for the name
<BR>Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.


<tr valign=top><td>MONTANO
<td>Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
<BR>Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
<BR>While I spare speech, which something now
<BR>offends me,--
<BR>Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
<BR>By me that's said or done amiss this night;
<BR>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
<BR>And to defend ourselves it be a sin
<BR>When violence assails us.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Now, by heaven,
<BR>My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
<BR>And passion, having my best judgment collied,
<BR>Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
<BR>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
<BR>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
<BR>How this foul rout began, who set it on;
<BR>And he that is approved in this offence,
<BR>Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
<BR>Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
<BR>Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
<BR>To manage private and domestic quarrel,
<BR>In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
<BR>'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?


<tr valign=top><td>MONTANO
<td>If partially affined, or leagued in office,
<BR>Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
<BR>Thou art no soldier.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Touch me not so near:
<BR>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
<BR>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
<BR>Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
<BR>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
<BR>Montano and myself being in speech,
<BR>There comes a fellow crying out for help:
<BR>And Cassio following him with determined sword,
<BR>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
<BR>Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
<BR>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
<BR>Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
<BR>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
<BR>Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
<BR>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
<BR>And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
<BR>I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
<BR>For this was brief--I found them close together,
<BR>At blow and thrust; even as again they were
<BR>When you yourself did part them.
<BR>More of this matter cannot I report:
<BR>But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
<BR>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
<BR>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
<BR>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
<BR>From him that fled some strange indignity,
<BR>Which patience could not pass.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO

<BR>Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
<BR>Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
<BR>But never more be officer of mine.

<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO

<BR>my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
<BR>myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
<BR>Iago, my reputation!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
<BR>some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
<BR>in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
<BR>imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
<BR>deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
<BR>unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
<BR>there are ways to recover the general again: you
<BR>are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
<BR>policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
<BR>offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
<BR>to him again, and he's yours.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
<BR>good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
<BR>indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
<BR>and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
<BR>fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
<BR>spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
<BR>let us call thee devil!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>What was he that you followed with your sword? What
<BR>had he done to you?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I know not.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Is't possible?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
<BR>a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
<BR>should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
<BR>their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
<BR>revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
<BR>recovered?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
<BR>to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
<BR>another, to make me frankly despise myself.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
<BR>the place, and the condition of this country
<BR>stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
<BR>but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
<BR>I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
<BR>such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
<BR>sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
<BR>beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
<BR>unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
<BR>if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
<BR>And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
<BR>I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
<BR>is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
<BR>that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
<BR>contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
<BR>graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
<BR>her help to put you in your place again: she is of
<BR>so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
<BR>she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
<BR>than she is requested: this broken joint between
<BR>you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
<BR>fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
<BR>crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>You advise me well.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
<BR>beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
<BR>I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
<BR>must to the watch.


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>Good night, honest Iago.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>And what's he then that says I play the villain?
<BR>When this advice is free I give and honest,
<BR>Probal to thinking and indeed the course
<BR>To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
<BR>The inclining Desdemona to subdue
<BR>In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
<BR>As the free elements. And then for her
<BR>To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
<BR>All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
<BR>His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
<BR>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
<BR>Even as her appetite shall play the god
<BR>With his weak function. How am I then a villain
<BR>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
<BR>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
<BR>When devils will the blackest sins put on,
<BR>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
<BR>As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
<BR>Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
<BR>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
<BR>I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
<BR>That she repeals him for her body's lust;
<BR>And by how much she strives to do him good,
<BR>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
<BR>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
<BR>And out of her own goodness make the net
<BR>That shall enmesh them all.

<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO

<BR>hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
<BR>almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
<BR>cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
<BR>have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
<BR>no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>How poor are they that have not patience!
<BR>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
<BR>Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
<BR>And wit depends on dilatory time.
<BR>Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
<BR>And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
<BR>Though other things grow fair against the sun,
<BR>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
<BR>Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
<BR>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.

<td>Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Nay, yet there's more in this:
<BR>I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
<BR>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
<BR>The worst of words.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Good my lord, pardon me:
<BR>Though I am bound to every act of duty,
<BR>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
<BR>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
<BR>As where's that palace whereinto foul things
<BR>Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
<BR>But some uncleanly apprehensions
<BR>Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
<BR>With meditations lawful?


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
<BR>If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
<BR>A stranger to thy thoughts.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I do beseech you--
<BR>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
<BR>As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
<BR>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
<BR>Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
<BR>From one that so imperfectly conceits,
<BR>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
<BR>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
<BR>It were not for your quiet nor your good,
<BR>Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
<BR>To let you know my thoughts.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>What dost thou mean?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
<BR>Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
<BR>Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
<BR>'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
<BR>But he that filches from me my good name
<BR>Robs me of that which not enriches him
<BR>And makes me poor indeed.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
<BR>Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Ha!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
<BR>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
<BR>The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
<BR>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
<BR>But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
<BR>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O misery!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
<BR>But riches fineless is as poor as winter
<BR>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
<BR>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
<BR>From jealousy!


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Why, why is this?
<BR>Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
<BR>To follow still the changes of the moon
<BR>With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
<BR>Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
<BR>When I shall turn the business of my soul
<BR>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
<BR>Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
<BR>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
<BR>Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
<BR>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
<BR>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
<BR>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
<BR>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
<BR>I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
<BR>And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
<BR>Away at once with love or jealousy!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
<BR>To show the love and duty that I bear you
<BR>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
<BR>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
<BR>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
<BR>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
<BR>I would not have your free and noble nature,
<BR>Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
<BR>I know our country disposition well;
<BR>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
<BR>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
<BR>Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Dost thou say so?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>She did deceive her father, marrying you;
<BR>And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
<BR>She loved them most.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>And so she did.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Why, go to then;
<BR>She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
<BR>To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
<BR>He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
<BR>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
<BR>For too much loving you.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>I am bound to thee for ever.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Not a jot, not a jot.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I' faith, I fear it has.
<BR>I hope you will consider what is spoke
<BR>Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
<BR>I am to pray you not to strain my speech
<BR>To grosser issues nor to larger reach
<BR>Than to suspicion.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>I will not.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Should you do so, my lord,
<BR>My speech should fall into such vile success
<BR>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
<BR>My lord, I see you're moved.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>No, not much moved:
<BR>I do not think but Desdemona's honest.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Long live she so! and long live you to think so!


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>And yet, how nature erring from itself,--


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
<BR>Not to affect many proposed matches
<BR>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
<BR>Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
<BR>Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
<BR>Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
<BR>But pardon me; I do not in position
<BR>Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
<BR>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
<BR>May fall to match you with her country forms
<BR>And happily repent.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Farewell, farewell:
<BR>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
<BR>Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO

<BR>Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreat
<BR>your honour
<BR>To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
<BR>Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
<BR>For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
<BR>Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
<BR>You shall by that perceive him and his means:
<BR>Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
<BR>With any strong or vehement importunity;
<BR>Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
<BR>Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
<BR>As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
<BR>And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

<BR>To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
<BR>And have not those soft parts of conversation
<BR>That chamberers have, or for I am declined

<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>By the world,
<BR>I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
<BR>I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
<BR>I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
<BR>As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
<BR>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
<BR>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
<BR>I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
<BR>I do repent me that I put it to you.

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
<BR>Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
<BR>To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
<BR>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
<BR>More than their own! What then? how then?

<BR>It is impossible you should see this,
<BR>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
<BR>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
<BR>As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
<BR>If imputation and strong circumstances,
<BR>Which lead directly to the door of truth,

<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Give me a living reason she's disloyal.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I do not like the office:
<BR>But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
<BR>Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
<BR>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
<BR>And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
<BR>I could not sleep.
<BR>There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
<BR>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
<BR>One of this kind is Cassio:
<BR>In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
<BR>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
<BR>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
<BR>Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
<BR>As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
<BR>That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
<BR>Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
<BR>Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O monstrous! monstrous!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Nay, this was but his dream.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
<BR>'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>And this may help to thicken other proofs
<BR>That do demonstrate thinly.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>I'll tear her all to pieces.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
<BR>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
<BR>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
<BR>Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
<BR>I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
<BR>See Cassio wipe his beard with.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>If it be that--


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>If it be that, or any that was hers,
<BR>It speaks against her with the other proofs.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
<BR>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
<BR>Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
<BR>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
<BR>'Tis gone.
<BR>Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
<BR>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
<BR>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
<BR>For 'tis of aspics' tongues!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Yet be content.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O, blood, blood, blood!


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
<BR>Whose icy current and compulsive course
<BR>Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
<BR>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
<BR>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,

<BR>Till that a capable and wide revenge
<BR>Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[They rise]


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO

<BR>Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
<BR>Or made gift of it, my father's eye
<BR>Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
<BR>After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
<BR>And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
<BR>To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
<BR>Make it a darling like your precious eye;

<td>How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
<BR>That by your virtuous means I may again
<BR>Exist, and be a member of his love
<BR>Whom I with all the office of my heart

<BR>If my offence be of such mortal kind
<BR>That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
<BR>Nor purposed merit in futurity,
<BR>Can ransom me into his love again,
<BR>But to know so must be my benefit;
<BR>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
<BR>And shut myself up in some other course,
<BR>To fortune's alms.


<tr valign=top><td>DESDEMONA
<td>Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
<BR>My advocation is not now in tune;
<BR>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
<BR>Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
<BR>So help me every spirit sanctified,
<BR>As I have spoken for you all my best
<BR>And stood within the blank of his displeasure
<BR>For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
<BR>What I can do I will; and more I will
<BR>Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Is my lord angry?


<tr valign=top><td>EMILIA
<td>He went hence but now,
<BR>And certainly in strange unquietness.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
<BR>When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
<BR>And, like the devil, from his very arm
<BR>Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
<BR>Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
<BR>There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.


<tr valign=top><td>DESDEMONA

<tr valign=top><td><td>Something, sure, of state,

<BR>Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
<BR>For let our finger ache, and it indues
<BR>Our other healthful members even to that sense
<BR>Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
<BR>Nor of them look for such observances
<BR>As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
<BR>I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
<BR>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
<BR>But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
<BR>And he's indicted falsely.

<BR>And no conception nor no jealous toy
<BR>Concerning you.


<tr valign=top><td>DESDEMONA
<td>Alas the day! I never gave him cause.


<tr valign=top><td>EMILIA
<td>But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
<BR>They are not ever jealous for the cause,

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
<BR>this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
<BR>ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
<BR>taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
<BR>protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>It hath not appeared.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO

<BR>purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
<BR>thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
<BR>take me from this world with treachery and devise
<BR>engines for my life.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO

<tr valign=top><td>IAGO

<BR>to depute Cassio in Othello's place.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
<BR>return again to Venice.


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
<BR>him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
<BR>lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
<BR>so determinate as the removing of Cassio.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>How do you mean, removing of him?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
<BR>knocking out his brains.


<tr valign=top><td>RODERIGO
<td>And that you would have me to do?


<tr valign=top><td>IAGO
<td>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
<BR>He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
<BR>go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
<BR>fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
<BR>I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
<BR>you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
<BR>to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
<BR>us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
<BR>me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
<BR>that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
<BR>him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
<BR>to waste: about it.

<BR>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
<BR>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
<BR>Or scant our former having in despite;
<BR>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
<BR>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
<BR>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
<BR>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
<BR>As husbands have. What is it that they do
<BR>When they change us for others? Is it sport?
<BR>I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
<BR>I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
<BR>It is so too: and have not we affections,
<BR>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
<BR>Then let them use us well: else let them know,
<BR>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

<BR>I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
<BR>Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
<BR>I know this act shows horrible and grim.


<tr valign=top><td>GRATIANO
<td>Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
<BR>Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
<BR>Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
<BR>This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
<BR>Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
<BR>And fall to reprobation.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
<BR>That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
<BR>A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
<BR>And she did gratify his amorous works
<BR>With that recognizance and pledge of love
<BR>Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
<BR>It was a handkerchief, an antique token

<BR>Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
<BR>Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
<BR>Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
<BR>Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
<BR>And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
<BR>Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
<BR>Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
<BR>And he retires. Where should Othello go?
<BR>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
<BR>Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
<BR>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
<BR>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
<BR>Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
<BR>Whip me, ye devils,
<BR>From the possession of this heavenly sight!
<BR>Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!

<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Well, thou dost best.


<tr valign=top><td>LODOVICO
<td>Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
<BR>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
<BR>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
<BR>And here another: the one of them imports
<BR>The death of Cassio to be undertook
<BR>By Roderigo.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O villain!


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>Most heathenish and most gross!


<tr valign=top><td>LODOVICO
<td>Now here's another discontented paper,
<BR>Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,

<BR>But that belike Iago in the interim
<BR>Came in and satisfied him.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O the pernicious caitiff!

<BR>And he himself confess'd but even now
<BR>That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
<BR>Which wrought to his desire.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>O fool! fool! fool!


<tr valign=top><td>CASSIO
<td>There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
<BR>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
<BR>Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
<BR>That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
<BR>After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
<BR>Iago set him on.


<tr valign=top><td>LODOVICO
<td>You must forsake this room, and go with us:
<BR>Your power and your command is taken off,
<BR>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
<BR>If there be any cunning cruelty
<BR>That can torment him much and hold him long,
<BR>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
<BR>Till that the nature of your fault be known
<BR>To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.


<tr valign=top><td>OTHELLO
<td>Soft you; a word or two before you go.
<BR>I have done the state some service, and they know't.
<BR>No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
<BR>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
<BR>Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
<BR>Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
<BR>Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
<BR>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
<BR>Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
<BR>Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
<BR>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
<BR>Albeit unused to the melting mood,
<BR>Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
<BR>Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
<BR>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
<BR>Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
<BR>Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
<BR>I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
<BR>And smote him, thus.

<BR>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
<BR>For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
