<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a
<BR>Messenger]


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
<BR>comes this night to Messina.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
<BR>when I left him.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>But few of any sort, and none of name.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
<BR>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
<BR>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
<BR>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
<BR>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
<BR>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
<BR>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
<BR>tell you how.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
<BR>glad of it.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>I have already delivered him letters, and there
<BR>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
<BR>not show itself modest enough without a badge of
<BR>bitterness.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Did he break out into tears?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>In great measure.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
<BR>truer than those that are so washed. How much
<BR>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
<BR>wars or no?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
<BR>in the army of any sort.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>What is he that you ask for, niece?


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
<BR>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
<BR>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
<BR>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
<BR>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
<BR>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
<BR>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
<BR>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
<BR>excellent stomach.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>And a good soldier too, lady.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
<BR>honourable virtues.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
<BR>but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
<BR>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
<BR>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
<BR>between them.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
<BR>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
<BR>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
<BR>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
<BR>bear it for a difference between himself and his
<BR>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
<BR>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
<BR>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>Is't possible?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
<BR>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
<BR>next block.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
<BR>you, who is his companion? Is there no young
<BR>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
<BR>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
<BR>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
<BR>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
<BR>thousand pound ere a' be cured.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>I will hold friends with you, lady.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Do, good friend.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>You will never run mad, niece.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No, not till a hot January.


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>Don Pedro is approached.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,
<BR>and BALTHASAR]


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
<BR>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
<BR>cost, and you encounter it.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
<BR>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
<BR>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
<BR>and happiness takes his leave.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
<BR>is your daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Her mother hath many times told me so.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
<BR>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
<BR>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
<BR>honourable father.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
<BR>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
<BR>like him as she is.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
<BR>Benedick: nobody marks you.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
<BR>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
<BR>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
<BR>in her presence.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
<BR>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
<BR>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
<BR>heart; for, truly, I love none.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>A dear happiness to women: they would else have
<BR>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
<BR>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
<BR>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
<BR>swear he loves me.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
<BR>gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
<BR>scratched face.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
<BR>a face as yours were.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
<BR>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
<BR>name; I have done.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
<BR>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
<BR>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
<BR>the least a month; and he heartily prays some
<BR>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
<BR>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To DON JOHN]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
<BR>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
<BR>you.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Please it your grace lead on?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO]


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I noted her not; but I looked on her.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Is she not a modest young lady?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
<BR>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
<BR>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
<BR>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
<BR>for a great praise: only this commendation I can
<BR>afford her, that were she other than she is, she
<BR>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
<BR>do not like her.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
<BR>truly how thou likest her.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Can the world buy such a jewel?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
<BR>with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
<BR>to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
<BR>rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
<BR>you, to go in the song?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
<BR>looked on.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
<BR>matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
<BR>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
<BR>as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
<BR>hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
<BR>contrary, if Hero would be my wife.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
<BR>one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
<BR>Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
<BR>Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
<BR>into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
<BR>Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter DON PEDRO]


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>What secret hath held you here, that you followed
<BR>not to Leonato's?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I would your grace would constrain me to tell.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I charge thee on thy allegiance.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
<BR>man; I would have you think so; but, on my
<BR>allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
<BR>in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
<BR>Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
<BR>short daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If this were so, so were it uttered.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
<BR>'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
<BR>so.'


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
<BR>should be otherwise.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>By my troth, I speak my thought.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>That I love her, I feel.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>That she is worthy, I know.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
<BR>know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
<BR>fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
<BR>of beauty.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And never could maintain his part but in the force
<BR>of his will.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
<BR>brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
<BR>thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
<BR>forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
<BR>all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
<BR>them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
<BR>right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
<BR>I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
<BR>not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
<BR>with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
<BR>out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
<BR>up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
<BR>blind Cupid.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
<BR>wilt prove a notable argument.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
<BR>at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
<BR>the shoulder, and called Adam.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
<BR>doth bear the yoke.'


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
<BR>Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
<BR>them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
<BR>and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
<BR>good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
<BR>'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
<BR>Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I look for an earthquake too, then.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
<BR>meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
<BR>Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
<BR>not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
<BR>great preparation.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I have almost matter enough in me for such an
<BR>embassage; and so I commit you--


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
<BR>discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
<BR>the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
<BR>you flout old ends any further, examine your
<BR>conscience: and so I leave you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>My liege, your highness now may do me good.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
<BR>And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
<BR>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Hath Leonato any son, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
<BR>Dost thou affect her, Claudio?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>O, my lord,
<BR>When you went onward on this ended action,
<BR>I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
<BR>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
<BR>Than to drive liking to the name of love:
<BR>But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
<BR>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
<BR>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
<BR>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
<BR>Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Thou wilt be like a lover presently
<BR>And tire the hearer with a book of words.
<BR>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
<BR>And I will break with her and with her father,
<BR>And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
<BR>That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>How sweetly you do minister to love,
<BR>That know love's grief by his complexion!
<BR>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
<BR>I would have salved it with a longer treatise.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
<BR>The fairest grant is the necessity.
<BR>Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
<BR>And I will fit thee with the remedy.
<BR>I know we shall have revelling to-night:
<BR>I will assume thy part in some disguise
<BR>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
<BR>And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
<BR>And take her hearing prisoner with the force
<BR>And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
<BR>Then after to her father will I break;
<BR>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
<BR>In practise let us put it presently.

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>As the event stamps them: but they have a good

<BR>impossible you should take true root but by the
<BR>fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
<BR>that you frame the season for your own harvest.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
<BR>his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
<BR>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
<BR>love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
<BR>be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
<BR>but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
<BR>a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
<BR>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
<BR>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
<BR>my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
<BR>seek not to alter me.


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>Can you make no use of your discontent?


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>I make all use of it, for I use it only.
<BR>Who comes here?

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BORACHIO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>What news, Borachio?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
<BR>brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
<BR>can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
<BR>What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
<BR>unquietness?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Marry, it is your brother's right hand.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Who? the most exquisite Claudio?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Even he.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
<BR>he?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
<BR>musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
<BR>in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
<BR>arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
<BR>prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
<BR>obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
<BR>my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
<BR>glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
<BR>bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>To the death, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
<BR>greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
<BR>my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>We'll wait upon your lordship.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others]



<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Was not Count John here at supper?


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>I saw him not.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
<BR>him but I am heart-burned an hour after.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>He is of a very melancholy disposition.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>He were an excellent man that were made just in the
<BR>midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
<BR>like an image and says nothing, and the other too
<BR>like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
<BR>mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
<BR>Benedick's face,--


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
<BR>enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
<BR>in the world, if a' could get her good-will.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
<BR>husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>In faith, she's too curst.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
<BR>sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
<BR>cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
<BR>blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
<BR>evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
<BR>beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
<BR>and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
<BR>beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
<BR>beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
<BR>a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
<BR>man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
<BR>sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
<BR>apes into hell.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Well, then, go you into hell?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
<BR>me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
<BR>say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
<BR>heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
<BR>I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
<BR>heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
<BR>there live we as merry as the day is long.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
<BR>by your father.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
<BR>and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
<BR>that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
<BR>make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
<BR>me.'


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Not till God make men of some other metal than
<BR>earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
<BR>overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
<BR>an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
<BR>No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
<BR>and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
<BR>do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
<BR>not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
<BR>important, tell him there is measure in every thing
<BR>and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
<BR>wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
<BR>a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
<BR>and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
<BR>fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
<BR>measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
<BR>repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
<BR>cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[All put on their masks]

<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>I may say so, when I please.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Drawing her aside]


<tr valign=top><td>BALTHASAR

<tr valign=top><td>BALTHASAR
<td>Which is one?


<tr valign=top><td>MARGARET

<tr valign=top><td>BALTHASAR

<tr valign=top><td>MARGARET

<tr valign=top><td>BALTHASAR
<td>No more words: the clerk is answered.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>At a word, I am not.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>I know you by the waggling of your head.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>To tell you true, I counterfeit him.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>At a word, I am not.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your

<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Will you not tell me who told you so?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>No, you shall pardon me.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Nor will you not tell me who you are?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Not now.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
<BR>out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
<BR>Signior Benedick that said so.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>What's he?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Not I, believe me.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Did he never make you laugh?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I pray you, what is he?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
<BR>only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
<BR>none but libertines delight in him; and the
<BR>commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
<BR>for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
<BR>they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
<BR>the fleet: I would he had boarded me.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
<BR>which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
<BR>strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO,

<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN

<BR>The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO

<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Are not you Signior Benedick?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>You know me well; I am he.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
<BR>he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
<BR>from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
<BR>do the part of an honest man in it.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>How know you he loves her?


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>I heard him swear his affection.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Come, let us to the banquet.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO]


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
<BR>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
<BR>'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
<BR>Friendship is constant in all other things
<BR>Save in the office and affairs of love:
<BR>Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
<BR>Let every eye negotiate for itself
<BR>And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
<BR>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
<BR>This is an accident of hourly proof,
<BR>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter BENEDICK]


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Count Claudio?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Yea, the same.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Come, will you go with me?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Whither?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Even to the next willow, about your own business,
<BR>county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
<BR>about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
<BR>your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
<BR>it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I wish him joy of her.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
<BR>sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
<BR>have served you thus?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I pray you, leave me.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
<BR>boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If it will not be, I'll leave you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
<BR>But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
<BR>know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
<BR>under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
<BR>am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
<BR>is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
<BR>that puts the world into her person and so gives me
<BR>out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter DON PEDRO]


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
<BR>I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
<BR>warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
<BR>that your grace had got the good will of this young
<BR>lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
<BR>either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
<BR>to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>To be whipped! What's his fault?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
<BR>overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
<BR>companion, and he steals it.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
<BR>transgression is in the stealer.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
<BR>and the garland too; for the garland he might have
<BR>worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
<BR>you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
<BR>the owner.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
<BR>you say honestly.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
<BR>gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
<BR>wronged by you.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
<BR>an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
<BR>answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
<BR>scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
<BR>myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
<BR>duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
<BR>with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
<BR>like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
<BR>me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
<BR>if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
<BR>there were no living near her; she would infect to
<BR>the north star. I would not marry her, though she
<BR>were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
<BR>he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
<BR>turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
<BR>the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
<BR>her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
<BR>some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
<BR>she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
<BR>sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
<BR>would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
<BR>and perturbation follows her.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Look, here she comes.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO]


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Will your grace command me any service to the
<BR>world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
<BR>to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
<BR>I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
<BR>furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
<BR>Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
<BR>Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
<BR>rather than hold three words' conference with this
<BR>harpy. You have no employment for me?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>None, but to desire your good company.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
<BR>endure my Lady Tongue.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
<BR>Signior Benedick.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
<BR>him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
<BR>marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
<BR>therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE

<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Not sad, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>How then? sick?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Neither, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
<BR>well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
<BR>something of that jealous complexion.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
<BR>though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
<BR>false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
<BR>fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
<BR>and his good will obtained: name the day of
<BR>marriage, and God give thee joy!


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
<BR>fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an

<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Speak, count, 'tis your cue.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
<BR>but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
<BR>you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
<BR>you and dote upon the exchange.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
<BR>with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
<BR>the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
<BR>ear that he is in her heart.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And so she doth, cousin.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
<BR>world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
<BR>corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>I would rather have one of your father's getting.
<BR>Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
<BR>father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Will you have me, lady?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No, my lord, unless I might have another for
<BR>working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
<BR>every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
<BR>was born to speak all mirth and no matter.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
<BR>becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
<BR>a merry hour.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
<BR>was a star danced, and under that was I born.
<BR>Cousins, God give you joy!


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE

<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>There's little of the melancholy element in her, my

<BR>not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
<BR>she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
<BR>herself with laughing.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
<BR>seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
<BR>things answer my mind.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
<BR>but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
<BR>dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
<BR>Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
<BR>Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
<BR>affection the one with the other. I would fain have
<BR>it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
<BR>you three will but minister such assistance as I
<BR>shall give you direction.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO

<tr valign=top><td>HERO

<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
<BR>I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble

<BR>will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
<BR>shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
<BR>two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
<BR>despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
<BR>shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
<BR>Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
<BR>ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,

<td>Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be

<BR>and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
<BR>evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO

<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Show me briefly how.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO

<BR>I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting

<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN

<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO

<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
<BR>the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
<BR>he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
<BR>Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
<BR>up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN

<BR>to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any

<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
<BR>the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
<BR>that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
<BR>prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
<BR>honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
<BR>reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
<BR>semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
<BR>thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
<BR>offer them instances; which shall bear no less
<BR>likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
<BR>hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
<BR>Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
<BR>before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
<BR>will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
<BR>absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
<BR>of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
<BR>assurance and all the preparation overthrown.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
<BR>it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and

<BR>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
<BR>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
<BR>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
<BR>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
<BR>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
<BR>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many

<BR>be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
<BR>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
<BR>against Benedick.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I should think this a gull, but that the

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
<BR>I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
<BR>with scorn, write to him that I love him?'


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>This says she now when she is beginning to write to
<BR>him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
<BR>there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO

<BR>found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>That.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
<BR>railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
<BR>to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
<BR>measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
<BR>should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
<BR>love him, I should.'


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
<BR>beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
<BR>sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
<BR>ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
<BR>is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
<BR>to herself: it is very true.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
<BR>other, if she will not discover it.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
<BR>torment the poor lady worse.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
<BR>excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
<BR>she is virtuous.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And she is exceeding wise.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>In every thing but in loving Benedick.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
<BR>a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
<BR>the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
<BR>cause, being her uncle and her guardian.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
<BR>have daffed all other respects and made her half
<BR>myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
<BR>what a' will say.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Were it good, think you?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
<BR>will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
<BR>she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
<BR>her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
<BR>accustomed crossness.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>She doth well: if she should make tender of her
<BR>love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
<BR>man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>He is a very proper man.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And I take him to be valiant.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
<BR>quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
<BR>avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
<BR>them with a most Christian-like fear.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
<BR>if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
<BR>quarrel with fear and trembling.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
<BR>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
<BR>he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
<BR>we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
<BR>good counsel.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
<BR>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
<BR>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
<BR>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
<BR>trust my expectation.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
<BR>must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
<BR>sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
<BR>another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
<BR>scene that I would see, which will be merely a

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO]


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the
<BR>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
<BR>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
<BR>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
<BR>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
<BR>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
<BR>the love come from her; they say too that she will
<BR>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
<BR>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
<BR>are they that hear their detractions and can put
<BR>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
<BR>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
<BR>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
<BR>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
<BR>no great argument of her folly, for I will be
<BR>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
<BR>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
<BR>because I have railed so long against marriage: but
<BR>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
<BR>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
<BR>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
<BR>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
<BR>No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
<BR>die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
<BR>were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
<BR>she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
<BR>her.

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
<BR>pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
<BR>not have come.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>You take pleasure then in the message?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in

<BR>no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
<BR>to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
<BR>that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
<BR>not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not

<tr valign=top><td>HERO

<BR>Our talk must only be of Benedick.
<BR>When I do name him, let it be thy part
<BR>To praise him more than ever man did merit:
<BR>My talk to thee must be how Benedick
<BR>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter BEATRICE, behind]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Now begin;

<BR>And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
<BR>So angle we for Beatrice; who even now

<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?


<tr valign=top><td>HERO

<BR>And never to let Beatrice know of it.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
<BR>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
<BR>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>O god of love! I know he doth deserve
<BR>As much as may be yielded to a man:
<BR>But Nature never framed a woman's heart
<BR>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
<BR>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
<BR>Misprising what they look on, and her wit
<BR>Values itself so highly that to her
<BR>All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
<BR>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
<BR>She is so self-endeared.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>Sure, I think so;
<BR>And therefore certainly it were not good
<BR>She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
<BR>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
<BR>But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
<BR>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
<BR>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
<BR>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
<BR>If low, an agate very vilely cut;
<BR>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
<BR>If silent, why, a block moved with none.
<BR>So turns she every man the wrong side out
<BR>And never gives to truth and virtue that
<BR>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
<BR>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
<BR>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
<BR>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
<BR>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
<BR>Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
<BR>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
<BR>It were a better death than die with mocks,
<BR>Which is as bad as die with tickling.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO

<BR>To stain my cousin with: one doth not know

<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.

<BR>Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA

<BR>And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
<BR>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:

<BR>vouchsafe me.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
<BR>of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
<BR>and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
<BR>with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
<BR>of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
<BR>mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
<BR>bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
<BR>him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
<BR>tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
<BR>tongue speaks.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Gallants, I am not as I have been.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>So say I	methinks you are sadder.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I hope he be in love.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
<BR>him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
<BR>he wants money.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I have the toothache.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Draw it.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Hang it!


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>What! sigh for the toothache?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Where is but a humour or a worm.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
<BR>it.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Yet say I, he is in love.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
<BR>a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
<BR>a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
<BR>shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
<BR>the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
<BR>the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
<BR>to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
<BR>fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
<BR>believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
<BR>mornings; what should that bode?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Hath any man seen him at the barber's?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
<BR>and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
<BR>stuffed tennis-balls.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
<BR>out by that?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>The greatest note of it is his melancholy.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And when was he wont to wash his face?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
<BR>what they say of him.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
<BR>a lute-string and now governed by stops.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
<BR>conclude he is in love.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Nay, but I know who loves him.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
<BR>all, dies for him.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>She shall be buried with her face upwards.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
<BR>signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
<BR>or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
<BR>hobby-horses must not hear.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO]

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>You may think I love you not: let that appear
<BR>hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
<BR>manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
<BR>well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
<BR>your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
<BR>labour ill bestowed.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Why, what's the matter?


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
<BR>shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Who, Hero?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Disloyal?


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
<BR>could say she were worse: think you of a worse
<BR>title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
<BR>further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
<BR>see her chamber-window entered, even the night
<BR>before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
<BR>to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
<BR>to change your mind.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>May this be so?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I will not think it.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>If you dare not trust that you see, confess not

<BR>more, proceed accordingly.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
<BR>her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
<BR>wed, there will I shame her.

<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Are you good men and true?


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
<BR>salvation, body and soul.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
<BR>they should have any allegiance in them, being
<BR>chosen for the prince's watch.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>First, who think you the most desertless man to be
<BR>constable?


<tr valign=top><td>First Watchman
<td>Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
<BR>write and read.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
<BR>you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
<BR>the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Watchman
<td>Both which, master constable,--


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
<BR>for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
<BR>no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
<BR>let that appear when there is no need of such
<BR>vanity. You are thought here to be the most
<BR>senseless and fit man for the constable of the
<BR>watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
<BR>charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
<BR>to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.


<tr valign=top><td>Second Watchman
<td>How if a' will not stand?


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
<BR>presently call the rest of the watch together and
<BR>thank God you are rid of a knave.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
<BR>of the prince's subjects.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>True, and they are to meddle with none but the
<BR>prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
<BR>the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
<BR>talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
<BR>belongs to a watch.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
<BR>watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
<BR>offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
<BR>stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
<BR>ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>How if they will not?


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
<BR>they make you not then the better answer, you may
<BR>say they are not the men you took them for.


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>Well, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
<BR>of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
<BR>kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
<BR>why the more is for your honesty.


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
<BR>hands on him?


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
<BR>that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
<BR>way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
<BR>show himself what he is and steal out of your company.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>You have been always called a merciful man, partner.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
<BR>a man who hath any honesty in him.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
<BR>to the nurse and bid her still it.


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
<BR>her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
<BR>lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>'Tis very true.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
<BR>to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
<BR>prince in the night, you may stay him.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
<BR>the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
<BR>the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
<BR>to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
<BR>man against his will.


<tr valign=top><td>VERGES
<td>By'r lady, I think it be so.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
<BR>any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
<BR>fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
<BR>Come, neighbour.


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
<BR>upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.


<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
<BR>about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
<BR>there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
<BR>Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE

<tr valign=top><td>Watchman

<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any

<BR>price they will.


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>I wonder at it.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
<BR>the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is

<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>Yes, it is apparel.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>I mean, the fashion.


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>Yes, the fashion is the fashion.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
<BR>seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
<BR>is?


<tr valign=top><td>Watchman
<td>[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
<BR>thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a

<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Didst thou not hear somebody?


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>No; 'twas the vane on the house.


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
<BR>fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
<BR>bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
<BR>sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
<BR>in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
<BR>priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
<BR>shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
<BR>where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
<BR>out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
<BR>thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
<BR>shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
<BR>wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
<BR>name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
<BR>chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
<BR>night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
<BR>tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
<BR>planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
<BR>John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.


<tr valign=top><td>CONRADE
<td>And thought they Margaret was Hero?


<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
<BR>devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
<BR>by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
<BR>the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
<BR>by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
<BR>Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
<BR>he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
<BR>at the temple, and there, before the whole
<BR>congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
<BR>and send her home again without a husband.


<tr valign=top><td>First Watchman
<td>We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!


<tr valign=top><td>Second Watchman

<BR>recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that

<tr valign=top><td>First Watchman

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO

<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO

<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>I do.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>If either of you know any inward impediment why you
<BR>should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
<BR>to utter it.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Know you any, Hero?


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>None, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Know you any, count?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I dare make his answer, none.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
<BR>do, not knowing what they do!


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
<BR>laughing, as, ah, ha, he!


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
<BR>Will you with free and unconstrained soul
<BR>Give me this maid, your daughter?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>As freely, son, as God did give her me.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And what have I to give you back, whose worth
<BR>May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Nothing, unless you render her again.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
<BR>There, Leonato, take her back again:
<BR>Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
<BR>She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
<BR>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
<BR>O, what authority and show of truth
<BR>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
<BR>Comes not that blood as modest evidence
<BR>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
<BR>All you that see her, that she were a maid,
<BR>By these exterior shows? But she is none:
<BR>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
<BR>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>What do you mean, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Not to be married,
<BR>Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
<BR>Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
<BR>And made defeat of her virginity,--


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I know what you would say: if I have known her,
<BR>You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
<BR>And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
<BR>No, Leonato,
<BR>I never tempted her with word too large;
<BR>But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
<BR>Bashful sincerity and comely love.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
<BR>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
<BR>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
<BR>But you are more intemperate in your blood
<BR>Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
<BR>That rage in savage sensuality.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Sweet prince, why speak not you?


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>What should I speak?
<BR>I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
<BR>To link my dear friend to a common stale.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>This looks not like a nuptial.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>True! O God!


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Leonato, stand I here?
<BR>Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
<BR>Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>All this is so: but what of this, my lord?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Let me but move one question to your daughter;
<BR>And, by that fatherly and kindly power
<BR>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>O, God defend me! how am I beset!
<BR>What kind of catechising call you this?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>To make you answer truly to your name.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
<BR>With any just reproach?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Marry, that can Hero;
<BR>Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
<BR>What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
<BR>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
<BR>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
<BR>I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
<BR>Myself, my brother and this grieved count
<BR>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
<BR>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
<BR>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
<BR>Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
<BR>A thousand times in secret.


<tr valign=top><td>DON JOHN
<td>Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
<BR>Not to be spoke of;
<BR>There is not chastity enough in language
<BR>Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
<BR>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
<BR>If half thy outward graces had been placed
<BR>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
<BR>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
<BR>Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
<BR>For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
<BR>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
<BR>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
<BR>And never shall it more be gracious.

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK

<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
<BR>Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
<BR>Death is the fairest cover for her shame
<BR>That may be wish'd for.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>How now, cousin Hero!


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Have comfort, lady.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Dost thou look up?


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Yea, wherefore should she not?


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
<BR>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
<BR>The story that is printed in her blood?
<BR>Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
<BR>For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
<BR>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
<BR>Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
<BR>Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
<BR>Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
<BR>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
<BR>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
<BR>Why had I not with charitable hand
<BR>Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
<BR>Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
<BR>I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
<BR>This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
<BR>But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
<BR>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
<BR>That I myself was to myself not mine,
<BR>Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
<BR>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
<BR>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
<BR>And salt too little which may season give
<BR>To her foul-tainted flesh!


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Sir, sir, be patient.
<BR>For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
<BR>I know not what to say.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No, truly not; although, until last night,
<BR>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
<BR>Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
<BR>Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
<BR>Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
<BR>Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Hear me a little; for I have only been
<BR>Silent so long and given way unto
<BR>This course of fortune [           ]
<BR>By noting of the lady I have mark'd
<BR>A thousand blushing apparitions
<BR>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
<BR>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
<BR>And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
<BR>To burn the errors that these princes hold
<BR>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
<BR>Trust not my reading nor my observations,
<BR>Which with experimental seal doth warrant
<BR>The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
<BR>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
<BR>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
<BR>Under some biting error.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Friar, it cannot be.
<BR>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
<BR>Is that she will not add to her damnation
<BR>A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
<BR>Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
<BR>That which appears in proper nakedness?


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Lady, what man is he you are accused of?


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>They know that do accuse me; I know none:
<BR>If I know more of any man alive
<BR>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
<BR>Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
<BR>Prove you that any man with me conversed
<BR>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
<BR>Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
<BR>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>There is some strange misprision in the princes.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Two of them have the very bent of honour;
<BR>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
<BR>The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
<BR>Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
<BR>These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
<BR>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
<BR>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
<BR>Nor age so eat up my invention,
<BR>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
<BR>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
<BR>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
<BR>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
<BR>Ability in means and choice of friends,
<BR>To quit me of them throughly.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Pause awhile,
<BR>And let my counsel sway you in this case.
<BR>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
<BR>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
<BR>And publish it that she is dead indeed;
<BR>Maintain a mourning ostentation
<BR>And on your family's old monument
<BR>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
<BR>That appertain unto a burial.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>What shall become of this? what will this do?


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
<BR>Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
<BR>But not for that dream I on this strange course,
<BR>But on this travail look for greater birth.
<BR>She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
<BR>Upon the instant that she was accused,
<BR>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
<BR>Of every hearer: for it so falls out
<BR>That what we have we prize not to the worth
<BR>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
<BR>Why, then we rack the value, then we find
<BR>The virtue that possession would not show us
<BR>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
<BR>When he shall hear she died upon his words,
<BR>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
<BR>Into his study of imagination,
<BR>And every lovely organ of her life
<BR>Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
<BR>More moving-delicate and full of life,
<BR>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
<BR>Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
<BR>If ever love had interest in his liver,
<BR>And wish he had not so accused her,
<BR>No, though he thought his accusation true.
<BR>Let this be so, and doubt not but success
<BR>Will fashion the event in better shape
<BR>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
<BR>But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
<BR>The supposition of the lady's death
<BR>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
<BR>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
<BR>As best befits her wounded reputation,
<BR>In some reclusive and religious life,
<BR>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
<BR>And though you know my inwardness and love
<BR>Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
<BR>Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
<BR>As secretly and justly as your soul
<BR>Should with your body.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Being that I flow in grief,
<BR>The smallest twine may lead me.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>'Tis well consented: presently away;
<BR>For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
<BR>Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
<BR>Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE]

<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK

<BR>come to take hands; and then, with public
<BR>accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,

<BR>manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
<BR>And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
<BR>Against yourself.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
<BR>Which falls into mine ears as profitless
<BR>As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
<BR>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
<BR>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
<BR>Bring me a father that so loved his child,
<BR>Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
<BR>And bid him speak of patience;
<BR>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
<BR>And let it answer every strain for strain,
<BR>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
<BR>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
<BR>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
<BR>Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
<BR>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
<BR>With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
<BR>And I of him will gather patience.
<BR>But there is no such man: for, brother, men
<BR>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
<BR>Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
<BR>Their counsel turns to passion, which before
<BR>Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
<BR>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
<BR>Charm ache with air and agony with words:
<BR>No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
<BR>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
<BR>But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
<BR>To be so moral when he shall endure
<BR>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
<BR>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Therein do men from children nothing differ.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
<BR>For there was never yet philosopher
<BR>That could endure the toothache patiently,
<BR>However they have writ the style of gods
<BR>And made a push at chance and sufferance.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
<BR>Make those that do offend you suffer too.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.

<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
<BR>Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
<BR>I fear thee not.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Marry, beshrew my hand,
<BR>If it should give your age such cause of fear:
<BR>In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
<BR>I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
<BR>As under privilege of age to brag
<BR>What I have done being young, or what would do

<BR>Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
<BR>That I am forced to lay my reverence by
<BR>And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
<BR>Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
<BR>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
<BR>Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
<BR>And she lies buried with her ancestors;
<BR>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
<BR>Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<td>Away! I will not have to do with you.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
<BR>to seek you both.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO

<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you

<td>[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain; I jest not:
<BR>I will make it good how you dare, with what you

<BR>a woodcock too?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
<BR>other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
<BR>said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
<BR>great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
<BR>'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
<BR>hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
<BR>is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
<BR>'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
<BR>believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
<BR>Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
<BR>there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
<BR>did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
<BR>virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
<BR>wast the properest man in Italy.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
<BR>not.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
<BR>did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
<BR>the old man's daughter told us all.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
<BR>hid in the garden.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave

<BR>hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
<BR>you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
<BR>the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
<BR>you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord

<tr valign=top><td>DOGBERRY
<td>Marry, sir, they have committed false report;

<BR>they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have

<BR>things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I

<tr valign=top><td>BORACHIO
<td>Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
<BR>do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
<BR>deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
<BR>could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
<BR>to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
<BR>to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
<BR>to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
<BR>the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
<BR>garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
<BR>marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
<BR>I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
<BR>to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my

<td>An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
<BR>the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
<BR>in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
<BR>no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
<BR>widow weeps.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>And how long is that, think you?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
<BR>rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
<BR>wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
<BR>impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
<BR>own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
<BR>praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
<BR>praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Very ill.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>And how do you?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Very ill too.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
<BR>you too, for here comes one in haste.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter URSULA]


<tr valign=top><td>URSULA
<td>Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
<BR>coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
<BR>falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
<BR>abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
<BR>fed and gone. Will you come presently?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Will you go hear this news, signior?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
<BR>buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
<BR>thee to thy uncle's.

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
<BR>Upon the error that you heard debated:

<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK

<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
<BR>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
<BR>And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt Ladies]

<tr valign=top><td><td>The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
<BR>To visit me. You know your office, brother:
<BR>You must be father to your brother's daughter
<BR>And give her to young Claudio.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>To do what, signior?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
<BR>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
<BR>Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>And I do with an eye of love requite her.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>The sight whereof I think you had from me,
<BR>From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
<BR>But, for my will, my will is your good will
<BR>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
<BR>In the state of honourable marriage:
<BR>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>My heart is with your liking.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>And my help.
<BR>Here comes the prince and Claudio.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or

<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Good morrow to this fair assembly.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
<BR>We here attend you. Are you yet determined
<BR>To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit ANTONIO]


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
<BR>That you have such a February face,
<BR>So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
<BR>Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
<BR>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
<BR>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
<BR>When he would play the noble beast in love.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
<BR>And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
<BR>And got a calf in that same noble feat
<BR>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Which is the lady I must seize upon?

<td>This same is she, and I do give you her.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
<BR>Before this friar and swear to marry her.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
<BR>I am your husband, if you like of me.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>And when I lived, I was your other wife:

<tr valign=top><td><td>And when you loved, you were my other husband.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO

<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>Nothing certainer:
<BR>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
<BR>And surely as I live, I am a maid.


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.


<tr valign=top><td>FRIAR FRANCIS
<td>All this amazement can I qualify:
<BR>When after that the holy rites are ended,
<BR>I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
<BR>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
<BR>And to the chapel let us presently.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Do not you love me?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Why, no; no more than reason.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
<BR>Have been deceived; they swore you did.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Do not you love me?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Troth, no; no more than reason.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
<BR>Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>They swore that you were almost sick for me.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
<BR>For here's a paper written in his hand,
<BR>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
<BR>Fashion'd to Beatrice.


<tr valign=top><td>HERO
<td>And here's another
<BR>Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
<BR>Containing her affection unto Benedick.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
<BR>Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
<BR>thee for pity.


<tr valign=top><td>BEATRICE
<td>I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
<BR>upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
<BR>for I was told you were in a consumption.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Peace! I will stop your mouth.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Kissing her]


<tr valign=top><td>DON PEDRO
<td>How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
<BR>wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
<BR>thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:
<BR>if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
<BR>nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
<BR>purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
<BR>purpose that the world can say against it; and
<BR>therefore never flout at me for what I have said
<BR>against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
<BR>conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
<BR>have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
<BR>kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.


<tr valign=top><td>CLAUDIO
<td>I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
<BR>that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
<BR>life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
<BR>question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
<BR>exceedingly narrowly to thee.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
<BR>we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
<BR>and our wives' heels.


<tr valign=top><td>LEONATO
<td>We'll have dancing afterward.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
<BR>thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
<BR>there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter a Messenger]


<tr valign=top><td>Messenger
<td>My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
<BR>And brought with armed men back to Messina.


<tr valign=top><td>BENEDICK
<td>Think not on him till to-morrow:
<BR>I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
<BR>Strike up, pipers.
