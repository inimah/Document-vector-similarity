<BR>Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
<BR>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
<BR>Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
<BR>This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
<BR>Like to a step-dame or a dowager
<BR>Long withering out a young man revenue.


<tr valign=top><td>HIPPOLYTA
<td>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
<BR>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
<BR>And then the moon, like to a silver bow
<BR>New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
<BR>Of our solemnities.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>Go, Philostrate,
<BR>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
<BR>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
<BR>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
<BR>The pale companion is not for our pomp.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit PHILOSTRATE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
<BR>And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
<BR>But I will wed thee in another key,
<BR>With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS]


<tr valign=top><td>EGEUS
<td>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?


<tr valign=top><td>EGEUS
<td>Full of vexation come I, with complaint
<BR>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
<BR>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
<BR>This man hath my consent to marry her.
<BR>Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
<BR>This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
<BR>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
<BR>And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
<BR>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
<BR>With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
<BR>And stolen the impression of her fantasy
<BR>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
<BR>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
<BR>Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
<BR>With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
<BR>Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
<BR>To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
<BR>Be it so she; will not here before your grace
<BR>Consent to marry with Demetrius,
<BR>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
<BR>As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
<BR>Which shall be either to this gentleman
<BR>Or to her death, according to our law
<BR>Immediately provided in that case.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
<BR>To you your father should be as a god;
<BR>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
<BR>To whom you are but as a form in wax
<BR>By him imprinted and within his power
<BR>To leave the figure or disfigure it.
<BR>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>So is Lysander.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>In himself he is;
<BR>But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
<BR>The other must be held the worthier.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
<BR>I know not by what power I am made bold,
<BR>Nor how it may concern my modesty,
<BR>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
<BR>But I beseech your grace that I may know
<BR>The worst that may befall me in this case,
<BR>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>Either to die the death or to abjure
<BR>For ever the society of men.
<BR>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
<BR>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
<BR>Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
<BR>You can endure the livery of a nun,
<BR>For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
<BR>To live a barren sister all your life,
<BR>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
<BR>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
<BR>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
<BR>But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
<BR>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
<BR>Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
<BR>Ere I will my virgin patent up
<BR>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
<BR>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
<BR>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
<BR>For everlasting bond of fellowship--
<BR>Upon that day either prepare to die
<BR>For disobedience to your father's will,
<BR>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
<BR>Or on Diana's altar to protest
<BR>For aye austerity and single life.


<tr valign=top><td>DEMETRIUS
<td>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
<BR>Thy crazed title to my certain right.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>You have her father's love, Demetrius;
<BR>Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.


<tr valign=top><td>EGEUS
<td>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
<BR>And what is mine my love shall render him.
<BR>And she is mine, and all my right of her
<BR>I do estate unto Demetrius.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
<BR>As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
<BR>My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
<BR>If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
<BR>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
<BR>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
<BR>Why should not I then prosecute my right?
<BR>Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
<BR>Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
<BR>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
<BR>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
<BR>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>I must confess that I have heard so much,
<BR>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
<BR>But, being over-full of self-affairs,
<BR>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
<BR>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
<BR>I have some private schooling for you both.
<BR>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
<BR>To fit your fancies to your father's will;
<BR>Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
<BR>Which by no means we may extenuate--
<BR>To death, or to a vow of single life.
<BR>Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
<BR>Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
<BR>I must employ you in some business
<BR>Against our nuptial and confer with you
<BR>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


<tr valign=top><td>EGEUS
<td>With duty and desire we follow you.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA]


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
<BR>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>Belike for want of rain, which I could well
<BR>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
<BR>Could ever hear by tale or history,
<BR>The course of true love never did run smooth;
<BR>But, either it was different in blood,--


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
<BR>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
<BR>Making it momentany as a sound,
<BR>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
<BR>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
<BR>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
<BR>And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
<BR>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
<BR>So quick bright things come to confusion.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
<BR>It stands as an edict in destiny:
<BR>Then let us teach our trial patience,
<BR>Because it is a customary cross,
<BR>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
<BR>Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
<BR>I have a widow aunt, a dowager
<BR>Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
<BR>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
<BR>And she respects me as her only son.
<BR>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
<BR>And to that place the sharp Athenian law
<BR>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
<BR>Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
<BR>And in the wood, a league without the town,
<BR>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
<BR>To do observance to a morn of May,
<BR>There will I stay for thee.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>My good Lysander!
<BR>I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
<BR>By his best arrow with the golden head,
<BR>By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
<BR>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
<BR>And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
<BR>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
<BR>By all the vows that ever men have broke,
<BR>In number more than ever women spoke,
<BR>In that same place thou hast appointed me,
<BR>To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter HELENA]


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>God speed fair Helena! whither away?


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
<BR>Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
<BR>Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
<BR>More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
<BR>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
<BR>Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
<BR>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
<BR>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
<BR>My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
<BR>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
<BR>The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
<BR>O, teach me how you look, and with what art
<BR>You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>O that my prayers could such affection move!


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>The more I hate, the more he follows me.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>The more I love, the more he hateth me.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
<BR>Lysander and myself will fly this place.
<BR>Before the time I did Lysander see,
<BR>Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
<BR>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
<BR>That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
<BR>To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
<BR>Her silver visage in the watery glass,
<BR>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
<BR>A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
<BR>Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.


<tr valign=top><td>HERMIA
<td>And in the wood, where often you and I
<BR>Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
<BR>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
<BR>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
<BR>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
<BR>To seek new friends and stranger companies.
<BR>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
<BR>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
<BR>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
<BR>From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.


<tr valign=top><td>LYSANDER
<td>I will, my Hermia.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit HERMIA]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Helena, adieu:
<BR>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>HELENA
<td>How happy some o'er other some can be!
<BR>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
<BR>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
<BR>He will not know what all but he do know:
<BR>And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
<BR>So I, admiring of his qualities:
<BR>Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
<BR>Love can transpose to form and dignity:
<BR>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
<BR>And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
<BR>Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
<BR>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
<BR>And therefore is Love said to be a child,
<BR>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
<BR>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
<BR>So the boy Love is perjured every where:
<BR>For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
<BR>He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
<BR>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
<BR>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
<BR>I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
<BR>Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
<BR>Pursue her; and for this intelligence
<BR>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
<BR>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
<BR>To have his sight thither and back again.

<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE

<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>You were best to call them generally, man by man,
<BR>according to the scrip.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
<BR>thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
<BR>interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
<BR>wedding-day at night.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
<BR>on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
<BR>to a point.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
<BR>most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
<BR>merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
<BR>actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>That will ask some tears in the true performing of
<BR>it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
<BR>eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
<BR>measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
<BR>tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
<BR>tear a cat in, to make all split.
<BR>The raging rocks
<BR>And shivering shocks
<BR>Shall break the locks
<BR>Of prison gates;
<BR>And Phibbus' car
<BR>Shall shine from far
<BR>And make and mar
<BR>The foolish Fates.
<BR>This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
<BR>This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
<BR>more condoling.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.


<tr valign=top><td>FLUTE
<td>Here, Peter Quince.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.


<tr valign=top><td>FLUTE
<td>What is Thisby? a wandering knight?


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.


<tr valign=top><td>FLUTE
<td>Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
<BR>you may speak as small as you will.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
<BR>speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
<BR>Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
<BR>and lady dear!'


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>Well, proceed.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Robin Starveling, the tailor.


<tr valign=top><td>STARVELING
<td>Here, Peter Quince.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
<BR>Tom Snout, the tinker.


<tr valign=top><td>SNOUT
<td>Here, Peter Quince.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
<BR>Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
<BR>hope, here is a play fitted.


<tr valign=top><td>SNUG
<td>Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
<BR>be, give it me, for I am slow of study.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
<BR>do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
<BR>that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
<BR>let him roar again.'


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
<BR>the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
<BR>and that were enough to hang us all.


<tr valign=top><td>ALL
<td>That would hang us, every mother's son.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
<BR>ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
<BR>discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
<BR>voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
<BR>sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
<BR>nightingale.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
<BR>sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
<BR>summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
<BR>therefore you must needs play Pyramus.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
<BR>to play it in?


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Why, what you will.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM
<td>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
<BR>beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
<BR>beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
<BR>perfect yellow.


<tr valign=top><td>QUINCE
<td>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
<BR>then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
<BR>are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
<BR>you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
<BR>and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
<BR>town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
<BR>we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
<BR>company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
<BR>will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
<BR>wants. I pray you, fail me not.


<tr valign=top><td>BOTTOM

<BR>obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

<tr valign=top><td>PUCK
<td>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
<BR>Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
<BR>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
<BR>Because that she as her attendant hath
<BR>A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
<BR>She never had so sweet a changeling;
<BR>And jealous Oberon would have the child
<BR>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
<BR>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
<BR>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
<BR>And now they never meet in grove or green,
<BR>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
<BR>But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
<BR>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.


<tr valign=top><td>Fairy

<BR>Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
<BR>That frights the maidens of the villagery;
<BR>Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
<BR>And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
<BR>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
<BR>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
<BR>Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
<BR>You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
<BR>Are not you he?


<tr valign=top><td>PUCK

<BR>I am that merry wanderer of the night.
<BR>I jest to Oberon and make him smile
<BR>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
<BR>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
<BR>And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
<BR>In very likeness of a roasted crab,
<BR>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
<BR>And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
<BR>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
<BR>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
<BR>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
<BR>And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
<BR>And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
<BR>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
<BR>A merrier hour was never wasted there.
<BR>But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.


<tr valign=top><td>Fairy

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;
<BR>from the other, TITANIA, with hers]


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.


<tr valign=top><td>TITANIA
<td>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
<BR>I have forsworn his bed and company.


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?


<tr valign=top><td>TITANIA
<td>Then I must be thy lady: but I know
<BR>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
<BR>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
<BR>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
<BR>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
<BR>Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
<BR>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
<BR>Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
<BR>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
<BR>To give their bed joy and prosperity.


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
<BR>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
<BR>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
<BR>Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
<BR>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
<BR>And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
<BR>With Ariadne and Antiopa?


<tr valign=top><td>TITANIA
<td>These are the forgeries of jealousy:
<BR>And never, since the middle summer's spring,
<BR>Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
<BR>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
<BR>Or in the beached margent of the sea,
<BR>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
<BR>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
<BR>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
<BR>As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
<BR>Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
<BR>Have every pelting river made so proud
<BR>That they have overborne their continents:
<BR>The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
<BR>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
<BR>Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
<BR>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
<BR>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
<BR>The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
<BR>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
<BR>For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
<BR>The human mortals want their winter here;
<BR>No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
<BR>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
<BR>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
<BR>That rheumatic diseases do abound:
<BR>And thorough this distemperature we see
<BR>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
<BR>Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
<BR>And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
<BR>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
<BR>Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
<BR>The childing autumn, angry winter, change
<BR>Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
<BR>By their increase, now knows not which is which:
<BR>And this same progeny of evils comes
<BR>From our debate, from our dissension;
<BR>We are their parents and original.


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
<BR>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
<BR>I do but beg a little changeling boy,
<BR>To be my henchman.


<tr valign=top><td>TITANIA
<td>Set your heart at rest:
<BR>The fairy land buys not the child of me.
<BR>His mother was a votaress of my order:
<BR>And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
<BR>Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
<BR>And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
<BR>Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
<BR>When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
<BR>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
<BR>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
<BR>Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
<BR>Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
<BR>To fetch me trifles, and return again,
<BR>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
<BR>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
<BR>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
<BR>And for her sake I will not part with him.


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>How long within this wood intend you stay?


<tr valign=top><td>TITANIA
<td>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
<BR>If you will patiently dance in our round
<BR>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
<BR>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON

<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
<BR>Till I torment thee for this injury.
<BR>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
<BR>Since once I sat upon a promontory,
<BR>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
<BR>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
<BR>That the rude sea grew civil at her song
<BR>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
<BR>To hear the sea-maid's music.


<tr valign=top><td>PUCK
<td>I remember.


<tr valign=top><td>OBERON
<td>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
<BR>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
<BR>Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
<BR>At a fair vestal throned by the west,
<BR>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
<BR>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
<BR>But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
<BR>Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
<BR>And the imperial votaress passed on,
<BR>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
<BR>Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
<BR>It fell upon a little western flower,
<BR>Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
<BR>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
<BR>Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
<BR>The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
<BR>Will make or man or woman madly dote
<BR>Upon the next live creature that it sees.
<BR>Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again

<td>My mistress with a monster is in love.
<BR>Near to her close and consecrated bower,
<BR>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
<BR>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
<BR>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
<BR>Were met together to rehearse a play
<BR>Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
<BR>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
<BR>Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
<BR>Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
<BR>When I did him at this advantage take,
<BR>An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
<BR>Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
<BR>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
<BR>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
<BR>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
<BR>Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
<BR>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
<BR>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
<BR>And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
<BR>He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
<BR>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
<BR>thus strong,
<BR>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
<BR>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
<BR>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
<BR>things catch.
<BR>I led them on in this distracted fear,
<BR>And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
<BR>When in that moment, so it came to pass,
<BR>Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

<BR>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
<BR>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,

<BR>And kill me too.
<BR>The sun was not so true unto the day
<BR>As he to me: would he have stolen away

<BR>Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,

<BR>Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
<BR>I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
<BR>For she his hairy temples then had rounded
<BR>With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
<BR>And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
<BR>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
<BR>Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
<BR>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
<BR>When I had at my pleasure taunted her

<BR>I then did ask of her her changeling child;
<BR>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent

<BR>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
<BR>But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
<BR>Melted as the snow, seems to me now
<BR>As the remembrance of an idle gaud
<BR>Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
<BR>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
<BR>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
<BR>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
<BR>Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
<BR>But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
<BR>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
<BR>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
<BR>And will for evermore be true to it.

<td>'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
<BR>lovers speak of.


<tr valign=top><td>THESEUS
<td>More strange than true: I never may believe
<BR>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
<BR>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
<BR>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
<BR>More than cool reason ever comprehends.
<BR>The lunatic, the lover and the poet
<BR>Are of imagination all compact:
<BR>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
<BR>That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
<BR>Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
<BR>The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
<BR>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
<BR>And as imagination bodies forth
<BR>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
<BR>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
<BR>A local habitation and a name.
<BR>Such tricks hath strong imagination,
<BR>That if it would but apprehend some joy,
<BR>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
<BR>Or in the night, imagining some fear,
<BR>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!


<tr valign=top><td>HIPPOLYTA
<td>But all the story of the night told over,

<td>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,

<BR>And tragical, my noble lord, it is;

<BR>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
<BR>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
<BR>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
<BR>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
<BR>And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
<BR>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
<BR>This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
<BR>Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
<BR>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
<BR>To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
<BR>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
<BR>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
<BR>Did scare away, or rather did affright;
<BR>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
<BR>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
<BR>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
<BR>And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
<BR>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
<BR>He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
<BR>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
<BR>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
<BR>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
<BR>At large discourse, while here they do remain.

<BR>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
<BR>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
<BR>Did whisper often very secretly.
<BR>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
<BR>That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
<BR>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
<BR>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

<tr valign=top><td>Moonshine

<BR>So shall all the couples three
<BR>Ever true in loving be;
<BR>And the blots of Nature's hand
<BR>Shall not in their issue stand;
<BR>Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
<BR>Nor mark prodigious, such as are
<BR>Despised in nativity,
<BR>Shall upon their children be.
<BR>With this field-dew consecrate,
<BR>Every fairy take his gait;
<BR>And each several chamber bless,
<BR>Through this palace, with sweet peace;
<BR>And the owner of it blest
<BR>Ever shall in safety rest.
<BR>Trip away; make no stay;
<BR>Meet me all by break of day.

<td>If we shadows have offended,
<BR>Think but this, and all is mended,
<BR>That you have but slumber'd here
<BR>While these visions did appear.
<BR>And this weak and idle theme,
<BR>No more yielding but a dream,
<BR>Gentles, do not reprehend:
<BR>if you pardon, we will mend:
<BR>And, as I am an honest Puck,
<BR>If we have unearned luck
<BR>Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
<BR>We will make amends ere long;
<BR>Else the Puck a liar call;
<BR>So, good night unto you all.
<BR>Give me your hands, if we be friends,
<BR>And Robin shall restore amends.
