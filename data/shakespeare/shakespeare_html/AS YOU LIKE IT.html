<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM]


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
<BR>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
<BR>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
<BR>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
<BR>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
<BR>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
<BR>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
<BR>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
<BR>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
<BR>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
<BR>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
<BR>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
<BR>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
<BR>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
<BR>which his animals on his dunghills are as much
<BR>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
<BR>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
<BR>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
<BR>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
<BR>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
<BR>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
<BR>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
<BR>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
<BR>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
<BR>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.


<tr valign=top><td>ADAM
<td>Yonder comes my master, your brother.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
<BR>shake me up.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter OLIVER]


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Now, sir! what make you here?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>What mar you then, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
<BR>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
<BR>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
<BR>come to such penury?


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Know you where your are, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Know you before whom, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
<BR>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
<BR>condition of blood, you should so know me. The
<BR>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
<BR>you are the first-born; but the same tradition
<BR>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
<BR>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
<BR>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
<BR>nearer to his reverence.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>What, boy!


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
<BR>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
<BR>a villain that says such a father begot villains.
<BR>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
<BR>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
<BR>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.


<tr valign=top><td>ADAM
<td>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
<BR>remembrance, be at accord.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Let me go, I say.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
<BR>father charged you in his will to give me good
<BR>education: you have trained me like a peasant,
<BR>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
<BR>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
<BR>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
<BR>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
<BR>give me the poor allottery my father left me by
<BR>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
<BR>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
<BR>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
<BR>pray you, leave me.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Get you with him, you old dog.


<tr valign=top><td>ADAM
<td>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
<BR>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
<BR>he would not have spoke such a word.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM]


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
<BR>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
<BR>crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DENNIS]


<tr valign=top><td>DENNIS
<td>Calls your worship?


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?


<tr valign=top><td>DENNIS
<td>So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
<BR>access to you.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Call him in.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit DENNIS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CHARLES]


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>Good morrow to your worship.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
<BR>new court?


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
<BR>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
<BR>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
<BR>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
<BR>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
<BR>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
<BR>banished with her father?


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
<BR>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
<BR>that she would have followed her exile, or have died
<BR>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
<BR>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
<BR>never two ladies loved as they do.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Where will the old duke live?


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
<BR>a many merry men with him; and there they live like
<BR>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
<BR>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
<BR>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
<BR>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
<BR>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
<BR>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
<BR>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
<BR>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
<BR>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
<BR>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
<BR>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
<BR>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
<BR>withal, that either you might stay him from his
<BR>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
<BR>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
<BR>and altogether against my will.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
<BR>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
<BR>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
<BR>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
<BR>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
<BR>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
<BR>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
<BR>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
<BR>me his natural brother: therefore use thy
<BR>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
<BR>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
<BR>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
<BR>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
<BR>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
<BR>treacherous device and never leave thee till he
<BR>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
<BR>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
<BR>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
<BR>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
<BR>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
<BR>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.


<tr valign=top><td>CHARLES
<td>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
<BR>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
<BR>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
<BR>so God keep your worship!


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Farewell, good Charles.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit CHARLES]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
<BR>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
<BR>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
<BR>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
<BR>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
<BR>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
<BR>people, who best know him, that I am altogether
<BR>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
<BR>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
<BR>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
<BR>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
<BR>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
<BR>learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
<BR>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
<BR>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
<BR>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
<BR>love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
<BR>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
<BR>tempered as mine is to thee.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
<BR>rejoice in yours.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
<BR>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
<BR>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
<BR>father perforce, I will render thee again in
<BR>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
<BR>that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
<BR>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
<BR>me see; what think you of falling in love?


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
<BR>love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
<BR>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
<BR>in honour come off again.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>What shall be our sport, then?


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
<BR>her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I would we could do so, for her benefits are
<BR>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
<BR>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
<BR>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
<BR>makes very ill-favouredly.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
<BR>Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
<BR>not in the lineaments of Nature.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter TOUCHSTONE]


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
<BR>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
<BR>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
<BR>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
<BR>Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
<BR>Nature's wit.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
<BR>Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
<BR>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
<BR>natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
<BR>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
<BR>wit! whither wander you?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Mistress, you must come away to your father.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Were you made the messenger?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Where learned you that oath, fool?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
<BR>were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
<BR>mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
<BR>pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
<BR>yet was not the knight forsworn.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>How prove you that, in the great heap of your
<BR>knowledge?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
<BR>swear by your beards that I am a knave.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
<BR>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
<BR>more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
<BR>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
<BR>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
<BR>speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
<BR>one of these days.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
<BR>wise men do foolishly.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
<BR>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
<BR>that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
<BR>Monsieur Le Beau.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>With his mouth full of news.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Then shall we be news-crammed.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter LE BEAU]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Sport! of what colour?


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>As wit and fortune will.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Or as the Destinies decree.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Nay, if I keep not my rank,--


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Thou losest thy old smell.


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
<BR>wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
<BR>your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
<BR>yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
<BR>to perform it.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>There comes an old man and his three sons,--


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>I could match this beginning with an old tale.


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
<BR>by these presents.'


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
<BR>duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
<BR>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
<BR>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
<BR>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
<BR>their father, making such pitiful dole over them
<BR>that all the beholders take his part with weeping.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Alas!


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
<BR>have lost?


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>Why, this that I speak of.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
<BR>time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
<BR>for ladies.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Or I, I promise thee.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>But is there any else longs to see this broken music
<BR>in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
<BR>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
<BR>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
<BR>perform it.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,
<BR>CHARLES, and Attendants]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE FREDERICK
<td>Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his

<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Is yonder the man?


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU

<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE FREDERICK
<td>How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
<BR>to see the wrestling?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE FREDERICK
<td>You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
<BR>there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
<BR>challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
<BR>will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
<BR>you can move him.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE FREDERICK
<td>Do so: I'll not be by.


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU
<td>Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I attend them with all respect and duty.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
<BR>come but in, as others do, to try with him the
<BR>strength of my youth.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
<BR>years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
<BR>strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
<BR>knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
<BR>adventure would counsel you to a more equal
<BR>enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
<BR>embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
<BR>be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
<BR>that the wrestling might not go forward.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
<BR>thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny

<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:

<BR>That here was at the wrestling?


<tr valign=top><td>LE BEAU

<BR>But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
<BR>The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
<BR>And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
<BR>To keep his daughter company; whose loves
<BR>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
<BR>But I can tell you that of late this duke
<BR>Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
<BR>Grounded upon no other argument
<BR>But that the people praise her for her virtues
<BR>And pity her for her good father's sake;
<BR>And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
<BR>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
<BR>Hereafter, in a better world than this,

<BR>Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
<BR>Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
<BR>More free from peril than the envious court?
<BR>Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,

<BR>Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,

<BR>Sweet are the uses of adversity,
<BR>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
<BR>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
<BR>And this our life exempt from public haunt

<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
<BR>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
<BR>Being native burghers of this desert city,
<BR>Should in their own confines with forked heads
<BR>Have their round haunches gored.


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>Indeed, my lord,
<BR>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
<BR>And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
<BR>Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
<BR>To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
<BR>Did steal behind him as he lay along
<BR>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
<BR>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
<BR>To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
<BR>That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
<BR>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
<BR>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
<BR>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
<BR>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
<BR>Coursed one another down his innocent nose
<BR>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
<BR>Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
<BR>Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
<BR>Augmenting it with tears.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>But what said Jaques?
<BR>Did he not moralize this spectacle?


<tr valign=top><td>First Lord
<td>O, yes, into a thousand similes.
<BR>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
<BR>'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
<BR>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
<BR>To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
<BR>Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
<BR>''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
<BR>The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
<BR>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
<BR>And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
<BR>'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
<BR>'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
<BR>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
<BR>Thus most invectively he pierceth through
<BR>The body of the country, city, court,
<BR>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
<BR>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
<BR>To fright the animals and to kill them up
<BR>In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.

<BR>And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
<BR>In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
<BR>'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,

<BR>And then he drew a dial from his poke,
<BR>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,

<BR>And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;

<BR>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
<BR>like it very well; but in respect that it is

<BR>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
<BR>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
<BR>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
<BR>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
<BR>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?


<tr valign=top><td>CORIN
<td>No more but that I know the more one sickens the
<BR>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
<BR>means and content is without three good friends;
<BR>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
<BR>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a

<td>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
<BR>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
<BR>happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
<BR>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
<BR>graze and my lambs suck.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
<BR>and the rams together and to offer to get your
<BR>living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
<BR>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
<BR>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
<BR>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not

<BR>Let no fair be kept in mind
<BR>But the fair of Rosalind.

<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND

<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>For a taste:
<BR>If a hart do lack a hind,
<BR>Let him seek out Rosalind.
<BR>If the cat will after kind,
<BR>So be sure will Rosalind.
<BR>Winter garments must be lined,
<BR>So must slender Rosalind.
<BR>They that reap must sheaf and bind;
<BR>Then to cart with Rosalind.
<BR>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
<BR>Such a nut is Rosalind.
<BR>He that sweetest rose will find
<BR>Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
<BR>This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you

<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
<BR>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit

<tr valign=top><td><td>Why should this a desert be?
<BR>For it is unpeopled? No:

<BR>That the stretching of a span
<BR>Buckles in his sum of age;
<BR>Some, of violated vows
<BR>'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:

<BR>Or at every sentence end,
<BR>Will I Rosalinda write,
<BR>Teaching all that read to know
<BR>The quintessence of every sprite
<BR>Heaven would in little show.
<BR>Therefore Heaven Nature charged
<BR>That one body should be fill'd
<BR>With all graces wide-enlarged:
<BR>Nature presently distill'd
<BR>Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
<BR>Cleopatra's majesty,
<BR>Atalanta's better part,
<BR>Sad Lucretia's modesty.
<BR>Thus Rosalind of many parts
<BR>By heavenly synod was devised,
<BR>Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
<BR>To have the touches dearest prized.

<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
<BR>themselves without the verse and therefore stood
<BR>lamely in the verse.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
<BR>should be hanged and carved upon these trees?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder

<BR>out of all hooping!


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
<BR>caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
<BR>my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
<BR>South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
<BR>quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
<BR>stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
<BR>out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
<BR>mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at

<BR>may drink thy tidings.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>So you may put a man in your belly.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND

<tr valign=top><td>CELIA

<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Why, God will send more, if the man will be
<BR>thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if

<BR>How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see

<tr valign=top><td>CELIA

<td>Very well: what would you?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I pray you, what is't o'clock?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
<BR>in the forest.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
<BR>sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
<BR>detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
<BR>been as proper?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
<BR>divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
<BR>withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
<BR>withal and who he stands still withal.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I prithee, who doth he trot withal?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
<BR>contract of her marriage and the day it is
<BR>solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
<BR>Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
<BR>seven year.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Who ambles Time withal?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
<BR>hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
<BR>he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
<BR>he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
<BR>and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
<BR>of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Who doth he gallop withal?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
<BR>softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Who stays it still withal?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
<BR>term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Where dwell you, pretty youth?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
<BR>skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Are you native of this place?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Your accent is something finer than you could
<BR>purchase in so removed a dwelling.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
<BR>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
<BR>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
<BR>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
<BR>him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
<BR>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
<BR>giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
<BR>whole sex withal.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
<BR>laid to the charge of women?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>There were none principal; they were all like one
<BR>another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
<BR>monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I prithee, recount some of them.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
<BR>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
<BR>abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
<BR>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
<BR>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
<BR>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
<BR>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
<BR>quotidian of love upon him.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
<BR>your remedy.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
<BR>taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
<BR>of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>What were his marks?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
<BR>sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
<BR>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
<BR>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
<BR>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
<BR>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
<BR>bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
<BR>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
<BR>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
<BR>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
<BR>loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
<BR>love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
<BR>do than to confess she does: that is one of the
<BR>points in the which women still give the lie to
<BR>their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
<BR>that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
<BR>is so admired?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
<BR>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
<BR>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
<BR>the reason why they are not so punished and cured
<BR>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
<BR>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Did you ever cure any so?


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
<BR>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
<BR>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
<BR>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
<BR>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
<BR>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
<BR>passion something and for no passion truly any
<BR>thing, as boys and women are for the most part
<BR>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
<BR>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
<BR>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
<BR>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
<BR>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
<BR>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
<BR>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
<BR>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
<BR>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I would not be cured, youth.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
<BR>and come every day to my cote and woo me.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
<BR>where it is.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
<BR>you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
<BR>Will you go?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>With all my heart, good youth.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
<BR>goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
<BR>doth my simple feature content you?


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
<BR>capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
<BR>in a thatched house!


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
<BR>man's good wit seconded with the forward child
<BR>Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
<BR>great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
<BR>the gods had made thee poetical.


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
<BR>deed and word? is it a true thing?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
<BR>feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
<BR>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
<BR>honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
<BR>hope thou didst feign.


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>Would you not have me honest?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
<BR>honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>[Aside]  A material fool!


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
<BR>make me honest.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
<BR>were to put good meat into an unclean dish.


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
<BR>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
<BR>be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
<BR>with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
<BR>village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
<BR>of the forest and to couple us.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.


<tr valign=top><td>AUDREY
<td>Well, the gods give us joy!


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
<BR>stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
<BR>but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
<BR>though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are
<BR>necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
<BR>his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
<BR>knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
<BR>his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
<BR>Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
<BR>hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
<BR>therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
<BR>worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
<BR>married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
<BR>bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
<BR>skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to

<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES

<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE

<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be

<BR>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be

<BR>He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
<BR>His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
<BR>There was a pretty redness in his lip,
<BR>A little riper and more lusty red
<BR>Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference

<BR>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him

<BR>My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
<BR>I know not the contents; but, as I guess

<BR>Which she did use as she was writing of it,
<BR>It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
<BR>I am but as a guiltless messenger.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Patience herself would startle at this letter
<BR>And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
<BR>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
<BR>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
<BR>Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
<BR>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
<BR>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
<BR>This is a letter of your own device.


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIUS
<td>No, I protest, I know not the contents:
<BR>Phebe did write it.

<td>Come, come, you are a fool
<BR>And turn'd into the extremity of love.

<BR>She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:

<BR>If the scorn of your bright eyne

<BR>Would they work in mild aspect!
<BR>Whiles you chid me, I did love;
<BR>How then might your prayers move!
<BR>He that brings this love to thee
<BR>Little knows this love in me:
<BR>And by him seal up thy mind;

<BR>love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
<BR>her: that if she love me, I charge her to love

<BR>He left a promise to return again
<BR>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
<BR>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
<BR>Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
<BR>And mark what object did present itself:
<BR>Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
<BR>And high top bald with dry antiquity,
<BR>A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
<BR>Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
<BR>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
<BR>Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
<BR>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
<BR>Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
<BR>And with indented glides did slip away
<BR>Into a bush: under which bush's shade
<BR>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
<BR>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
<BR>When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
<BR>The royal disposition of that beast
<BR>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
<BR>This seen, Orlando did approach the man
<BR>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA
<td>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
<BR>And he did render him the most unnatural
<BR>That lived amongst men.


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>And well he might so do,
<BR>For well I know he was unnatural.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
<BR>Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?


<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER
<td>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
<BR>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
<BR>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
<BR>Made him give battle to the lioness,
<BR>Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
<BR>From miserable slumber I awaked.


<tr valign=top><td>CELIA

<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND

<BR>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND

<tr valign=top><td>OLIVER

<BR>When from the first to last betwixt us two
<BR>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
<BR>As how I came into that desert place:--
<BR>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
<BR>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
<BR>Committing me unto my brother's love;
<BR>Who led me instantly unto his cave,
<BR>There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
<BR>The lioness had torn some flesh away,
<BR>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
<BR>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
<BR>Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
<BR>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
<BR>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
<BR>To tell this story, that you might excuse
<BR>His broken promise, and to give this napkin
<BR>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER,
<BR>and CELIA]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
<BR>Can do all this that he hath promised?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
<BR>As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE]


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
<BR>You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
<BR>You will bestow her on Orlando here?


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?


<tr valign=top><td>PHEBE
<td>That will I, should I die the hour after.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>But if you do refuse to marry me,
<BR>You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?


<tr valign=top><td>PHEBE
<td>So is the bargain.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?


<tr valign=top><td>SILVIUS
<td>Though to have her and death were both one thing.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I have promised to make all this matter even.
<BR>Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
<BR>You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
<BR>Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
<BR>Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
<BR>Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
<BR>If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
<BR>To make these doubts all even.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>I do remember in this shepherd boy
<BR>Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
<BR>Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
<BR>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
<BR>And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
<BR>Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
<BR>Whom he reports to be a great magician,
<BR>Obscured in the circle of this forest.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
<BR>couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
<BR>very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Salutation and greeting to you all!


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
<BR>motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
<BR>the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
<BR>purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
<BR>a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
<BR>with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
<BR>had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>And how was that ta'en up?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
<BR>seventh cause.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>I like him very well.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
<BR>press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
<BR>copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
<BR>marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
<BR>sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
<BR>humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
<BR>will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
<BR>poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
<BR>quarrel on the seventh cause?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
<BR>seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
<BR>cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
<BR>if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
<BR>mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
<BR>If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
<BR>would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
<BR>this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
<BR>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
<BR>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
<BR>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
<BR>is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
<BR>well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
<BR>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
<BR>Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
<BR>nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
<BR>measured swords and parted.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?


<tr valign=top><td>TOUCHSTONE
<td>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
<BR>books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
<BR>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
<BR>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
<BR>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
<BR>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
<BR>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
<BR>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
<BR>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
<BR>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
<BR>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
<BR>of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
<BR>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
<BR>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
<BR>any thing and yet a fool.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
<BR>the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Still Music]


<tr valign=top><td>HYMEN
<td>Then is there mirth in heaven,
<BR>When earthly things made even
<BR>Atone together.
<BR>Good duke, receive thy daughter
<BR>Hymen from heaven brought her,
<BR>Yea, brought her hither,
<BR>That thou mightst join her hand with his
<BR>Whose heart within his bosom is.


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To ORLANDO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>To you I give myself, for I am yours.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.


<tr valign=top><td>ORLANDO
<td>If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.


<tr valign=top><td>PHEBE
<td>If sight and shape be true,
<BR>Why then, my love adieu!


<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>I'll have no father, if you be not he:
<BR>I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
<BR>Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.


<tr valign=top><td>HYMEN
<td>Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
<BR>'Tis I must make conclusion
<BR>Of these most strange events:
<BR>Here's eight that must take hands
<BR>To join in Hymen's bands,
<BR>If truth holds true contents.
<BR>You and you no cross shall part:
<BR>You and you are heart in heart
<BR>You to his love must accord,
<BR>Or have a woman to your lord:
<BR>You and you are sure together,
<BR>As the winter to foul weather.
<BR>Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
<BR>Feed yourselves with questioning;
<BR>That reason wonder may diminish,
<BR>How thus we met, and these things finish.

<tr valign=top><td><td>SONG.
<BR>Wedding is great Juno's crown:
<BR>O blessed bond of board and bed!
<BR>'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
<BR>High wedlock then be honoured:
<BR>Honour, high honour and renown,
<BR>To Hymen, god of every town!


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
<BR>Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.


<tr valign=top><td>PHEBE
<td>I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
<BR>Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter JAQUES DE BOYS]


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES DE BOYS
<td>Let me have audience for a word or two:
<BR>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
<BR>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
<BR>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
<BR>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
<BR>Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
<BR>In his own conduct, purposely to take
<BR>His brother here and put him to the sword:
<BR>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
<BR>Where meeting with an old religious man,
<BR>After some question with him, was converted
<BR>Both from his enterprise and from the world,
<BR>His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
<BR>And all their lands restored to them again
<BR>That were with him exiled. This to be true,
<BR>I do engage my life.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>Welcome, young man;
<BR>Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
<BR>To one his lands withheld, and to the other
<BR>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
<BR>First, in this forest, let us do those ends
<BR>That here were well begun and well begot:
<BR>And after, every of this happy number
<BR>That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
<BR>Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
<BR>According to the measure of their states.
<BR>Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
<BR>And fall into our rustic revelry.
<BR>Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
<BR>With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
<BR>The duke hath put on a religious life
<BR>And thrown into neglect the pompous court?


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES DE BOYS
<td>He hath.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>To him will I : out of these convertites
<BR>There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To DUKE SENIOR]

<tr valign=top><td><td>You to your former honour I bequeath;
<BR>Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To ORLANDO]

<tr valign=top><td><td>You to a love that your true faith doth merit:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To OLIVER]

<tr valign=top><td><td>You to your land and love and great allies:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To SILVIUS]

<tr valign=top><td><td>You to a long and well-deserved bed:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[To TOUCHSTONE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
<BR>Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
<BR>I am for other than for dancing measures.


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>Stay, Jaques, stay.


<tr valign=top><td>JAQUES
<td>To see no pastime I	what you would have
<BR>I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>DUKE SENIOR
<td>Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
<BR>As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[A dance]





<tr valign=top><td><td>EPILOGUE



<tr valign=top><td>ROSALIND
<td>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
<BR>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
<BR>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
<BR>no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
<BR>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
<BR>and good plays prove the better by the help of good
<BR>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
<BR>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
<BR>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
<BR>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
<BR>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
<BR>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
<BR>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
<BR>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
<BR>you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
<BR>none of you hates them--that between you and the
<BR>women the play may please. If I were a woman I
<BR>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
<BR>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
<BR>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
<BR>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
<BR>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
