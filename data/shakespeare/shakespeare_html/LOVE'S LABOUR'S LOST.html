<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE
<BR>and DUMAIN]


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
<BR>Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
<BR>And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
<BR>When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
<BR>The endeavor of this present breath may buy
<BR>That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
<BR>And make us heirs of all eternity.
<BR>Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
<BR>That war against your own affections
<BR>And the huge army of the world's desires,--
<BR>Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
<BR>Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
<BR>Our court shall be a little Academe,
<BR>Still and contemplative in living art.
<BR>You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
<BR>Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
<BR>My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
<BR>That are recorded in this schedule here:
<BR>Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
<BR>That his own hand may strike his honour down
<BR>That violates the smallest branch herein:
<BR>If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
<BR>Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
<BR>The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
<BR>Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
<BR>Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.


<tr valign=top><td>DUMAIN
<td>My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
<BR>The grosser manner of these world's delights
<BR>He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
<BR>To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
<BR>With all these living in philosophy.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>I can but say their protestation over;
<BR>So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
<BR>That is, to live and study here three years.
<BR>But there are other strict observances;
<BR>As, not to see a woman in that term,
<BR>Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
<BR>And one day in a week to touch no food
<BR>And but one meal on every day beside,
<BR>The which I hope is not enrolled there;
<BR>And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
<BR>And not be seen to wink of all the day--
<BR>When I was wont to think no harm all night
<BR>And make a dark night too of half the day--
<BR>Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
<BR>O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
<BR>Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
<BR>I only swore to study with your grace
<BR>And stay here in your court for three years' space.


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
<BR>What is the end of study? let me know.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Why, that to know, which else we should not know.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
<BR>To know the thing I am forbid to know:
<BR>As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
<BR>When I to feast expressly am forbid;
<BR>Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
<BR>When mistresses from common sense are hid;
<BR>Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
<BR>Study to break it and not break my troth.
<BR>If study's gain be thus and this be so,
<BR>Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
<BR>Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>These be the stops that hinder study quite
<BR>And train our intellects to vain delight.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
<BR>Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
<BR>As, painfully to pore upon a book
<BR>To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
<BR>Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
<BR>Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
<BR>So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
<BR>Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
<BR>Study me how to please the eye indeed
<BR>By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
<BR>Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
<BR>And give him light that it was blinded by.
<BR>Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
<BR>That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
<BR>Small have continual plodders ever won
<BR>Save base authority from others' books
<BR>These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
<BR>That give a name to every fixed star
<BR>Have no more profit of their shining nights
<BR>Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
<BR>Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
<BR>And every godfather can give a name.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>How well he's read, to reason against reading!


<tr valign=top><td>DUMAIN
<td>Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.


<tr valign=top><td>DUMAIN
<td>How follows that?


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Fit in his place and time.


<tr valign=top><td>DUMAIN
<td>In reason nothing.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Something then in rhyme.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
<BR>That bites the first-born infants of the spring.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
<BR>Before the birds have any cause to sing?
<BR>Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
<BR>At Christmas I no more desire a rose
<BR>Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
<BR>But like of each thing that in season grows.
<BR>So you, to study now it is too late,
<BR>Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
<BR>And though I have for barbarism spoke more
<BR>Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
<BR>Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
<BR>And bide the penance of each three years' day.
<BR>Give me the paper; let me read the same;
<BR>And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
<BR>mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>Four days ago.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Let's see the penalty.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Reads]

<tr valign=top><td><td>'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>Marry, that did I.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Sweet lord, and why?


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>A dangerous law against gentility!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Reads]

<tr valign=top><td><td>'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
<BR>within the term of three years, he shall endure such
<BR>public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
<BR>This article, my liege, yourself must break;
<BR>For well you know here comes in embassy
<BR>The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
<BR>A maid of grace and complete majesty--
<BR>About surrender up of Aquitaine
<BR>To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
<BR>Therefore this article is made in vain,
<BR>Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>So study evermore is overshot:
<BR>While it doth study to have what it would
<BR>It doth forget to do the thing it should,
<BR>And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
<BR>'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>We must of force dispense with this decree;
<BR>She must lie here on mere necessity.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Necessity will make us all forsworn
<BR>Three thousand times within this three years' space;
<BR>For every man with his affects is born,
<BR>Not by might master'd but by special grace:
<BR>If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
<BR>I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
<BR>So to the laws at large I write my name:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Subscribes]

<tr valign=top><td><td>And he that breaks them in the least degree
<BR>Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
<BR>Suggestions are to other as to me;
<BR>But I believe, although I seem so loath,
<BR>I am the last that will last keep his oath.
<BR>But is there no quick recreation granted?


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
<BR>With a refined traveller of Spain;
<BR>A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
<BR>That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
<BR>One whom the music of his own vain tongue
<BR>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
<BR>A man of complements, whom right and wrong
<BR>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
<BR>This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
<BR>For interim to our studies shall relate
<BR>In high-born words the worth of many a knight
<BR>From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
<BR>How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
<BR>But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
<BR>And I will use him for my minstrelsy.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Armado is a most illustrious wight,
<BR>A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
<BR>And so to study, three years is but short.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD]


<tr valign=top><td>DULL
<td>Which is the duke's own person?


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>This, fellow: what wouldst?


<tr valign=top><td>DULL
<td>I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
<BR>grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
<BR>in flesh and blood.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>This is he.


<tr valign=top><td>DULL
<td>Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
<BR>abroad: this letter will tell you more.


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>A letter from the magnificent Armado.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>To hear? or forbear laughing?


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
<BR>forbear both.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
<BR>climb in the merriness.


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
<BR>The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>In what manner?


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
<BR>I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
<BR>her upon the form, and taken following her into the
<BR>park; which, put together, is in manner and form
<BR>following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
<BR>manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
<BR>in some form.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>For the following, sir?


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
<BR>the right!


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Will you hear this letter with attention?


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>As we would hear an oracle.


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
<BR>sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
<BR>and body's fostering patron.'


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Not a word of Costard yet.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'So it is,'--


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
<BR>telling true, but so.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Peace!


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Be to me and every man that dares not fight!


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>No words!


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
<BR>melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
<BR>to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
<BR>air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
<BR>walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
<BR>beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
<BR>to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
<BR>for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
<BR>I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
<BR>for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
<BR>that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
<BR>from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
<BR>here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
<BR>but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east

<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Still me?


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>O, me!


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
<BR>established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
<BR>which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
<BR>wherewith,--


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>With a wench.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
<BR>female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
<BR>woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
<BR>have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
<BR>punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
<BR>Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
<BR>estimation.'


<tr valign=top><td>DULL
<td>'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel

<BR>and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
<BR>her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
<BR>and heart-burning heat of duty.
<BR>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
<BR>that ever I heard.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say

<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>Sir, I confess the wench.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Did you hear the proclamation?


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
<BR>the marking of it.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
<BR>with a wench.


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>This maid will not serve your turn, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>This maid will serve my turn, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
<BR>a week with bran and water.


<tr valign=top><td>COSTARD
<td>I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
<BR>My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
<BR>And go we, lords, to put in practise that

<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>O, some authority how to proceed;
<BR>Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.


<tr valign=top><td>DUMAIN
<td>Some salve for perjury.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>'Tis more than need.
<BR>Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
<BR>Consider what you first did swear unto,
<BR>To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
<BR>Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
<BR>Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
<BR>And abstinence engenders maladies.
<BR>And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
<BR>In that each of you have forsworn his book,
<BR>Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
<BR>For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
<BR>Have found the ground of study's excellence
<BR>Without the beauty of a woman's face?
<BR>[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
<BR>They are the ground, the books, the academes
<BR>From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire]
<BR>Why, universal plodding poisons up
<BR>The nimble spirits in the arteries,
<BR>As motion and long-during action tires
<BR>The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
<BR>Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
<BR>You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
<BR>And study too, the causer of your vow;
<BR>For where is any author in the world
<BR>Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
<BR>Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
<BR>And where we are our learning likewise is:
<BR>Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
<BR>Do we not likewise see our learning there?
<BR>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
<BR>And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
<BR>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
<BR>In leaden contemplation have found out
<BR>Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
<BR>Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
<BR>Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
<BR>And therefore, finding barren practisers,
<BR>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
<BR>But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
<BR>Lives not alone immured in the brain;
<BR>But, with the motion of all elements,
<BR>Courses as swift as thought in every power,
<BR>And gives to every power a double power,
<BR>Above their functions and their offices.
<BR>It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
<BR>A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
<BR>A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
<BR>When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
<BR>Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
<BR>Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
<BR>Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
<BR>For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
<BR>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
<BR>Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
<BR>As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
<BR>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
<BR>Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
<BR>Never durst poet touch a pen to write
<BR>Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
<BR>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
<BR>And plant in tyrants mild humility.
<BR>From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
<BR>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
<BR>They are the books, the arts, the academes,
<BR>That show, contain and nourish all the world:
<BR>Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
<BR>Then fools you were these women to forswear,
<BR>Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
<BR>For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
<BR>Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
<BR>Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
<BR>Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
<BR>Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
<BR>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
<BR>It is religion to be thus forsworn,
<BR>For charity itself fulfills the law,
<BR>And who can sever love from charity?


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
<BR>Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
<BR>In conflict that you get the sun of them.


<tr valign=top><td>LONGAVILLE
<td>Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
<BR>Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>And win them too: therefore let us devise
<BR>Some entertainment for them in their tents.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
<BR>Then homeward every man attach the hand
<BR>Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
<BR>We will with some strange pastime solace them,
<BR>Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
<BR>For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
<BR>Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.


<tr valign=top><td>FERDINAND
<td>Away, away! no time shall be omitted
<BR>That will betime, and may by us be fitted.


<tr valign=top><td>BIRON
<td>Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
<BR>And justice always whirls in equal measure:
<BR>Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
<BR>If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

<BR>And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
<BR>When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
<BR>And maidens bleach their summer smocks
<BR>The cuckoo then, on every tree,
<BR>Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;
<BR>Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
<BR>Unpleasing to a married ear!

<tr valign=top><td><td>WINTER.
<BR>When icicles hang by the wall
<BR>And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
<BR>And Tom bears logs into the hall
<BR>And milk comes frozen home in pail,
<BR>When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
<BR>Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;
<BR>Tu-who, a merry note,
<BR>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

<tr valign=top><td><td>When all aloud the wind doth blow
<BR>And coughing drowns the parson's saw
<BR>And birds sit brooding in the snow
<BR>And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
<BR>When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
<BR>Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;
<BR>Tu-who, a merry note,
<BR>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
