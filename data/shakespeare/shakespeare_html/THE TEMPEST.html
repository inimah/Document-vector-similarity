<tr valign=top><td>Master

<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain

<tr valign=top><td>Master
<td>Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter Mariners]


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,

<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
<BR>Play the men.


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>I pray now, keep below.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Where is the master, boatswain?


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
<BR>cabins: you do assist the storm.


<tr valign=top><td>GONZALO
<td>Nay, good, be patient.


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
<BR>for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.


<tr valign=top><td>GONZALO
<td>Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>None that I more love than myself. You are a
<BR>counsellor; if you can command these elements to
<BR>silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
<BR>not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
<BR>cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
<BR>yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
<BR>the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
<BR>of our way, I say.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>GONZALO
<td>I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
<BR>hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
<BR>perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
<BR>hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
<BR>for our own doth little advantage. If he be not

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt]

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter Boatswain]

<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain

<tr valign=top><td>GONZALO
<td>The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
<BR>For our case is as theirs.


<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>I'm out of patience.


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
<BR>This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
<BR>The washing of ten tides!


<tr valign=top><td>GONZALO
<td>He'll be hang'd yet,
<BR>Though every drop of water swear against it
<BR>And gape at widest to glut him.

<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO

<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>Let's take leave of him.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]


<tr valign=top><td>GONZALO
<td>Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an

<BR>thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain

<HR><H3><A NAME="xref004">Scene II	The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.</A></H3>


<TABLE width="100%">
<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>If by your art, my dearest father, you have
<BR>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
<BR>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
<BR>But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
<BR>Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
<BR>With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
<BR>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
<BR>Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
<BR>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
<BR>Had I been any god of power, I would
<BR>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
<BR>It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
<BR>The fraughting souls within her.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Be collected:
<BR>No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
<BR>There's no harm done.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>O, woe the day!


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>No harm.
<BR>I have done nothing but in care of thee,
<BR>Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
<BR>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
<BR>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
<BR>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
<BR>And thy no greater father.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>More to know
<BR>Did never meddle with my thoughts.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>'Tis time
<BR>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
<BR>And pluck my magic garment from me. So:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Lays down his mantle]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
<BR>The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
<BR>The very virtue of compassion in thee,
<BR>I have with such provision in mine art
<BR>So safely ordered that there is no soul--
<BR>No, not so much perdition as an hair
<BR>Betid to any creature in the vessel
<BR>Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
<BR>For thou must now know farther.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>You have often
<BR>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
<BR>And left me to a bootless inquisition,
<BR>Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>The hour's now come;
<BR>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
<BR>Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
<BR>A time before we came unto this cell?
<BR>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
<BR>Out three years old.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Certainly, sir, I can.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>By what? by any other house or person?
<BR>Of any thing the image tell me that
<BR>Hath kept with thy remembrance.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>'Tis far off
<BR>And rather like a dream than an assurance
<BR>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
<BR>Four or five women once that tended me?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
<BR>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
<BR>In the dark backward and abysm of time?
<BR>If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
<BR>How thou camest here thou mayst.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>But that I do not.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
<BR>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
<BR>A prince of power.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Sir, are not you my father?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
<BR>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
<BR>Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
<BR>And princess no worse issued.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>O the heavens!
<BR>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
<BR>Or blessed was't we did?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Both, both, my girl:
<BR>By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
<BR>But blessedly holp hither.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>O, my heart bleeds
<BR>To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
<BR>Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
<BR>I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
<BR>Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
<BR>Of all the world I loved and to him put
<BR>The manage of my state; as at that time
<BR>Through all the signories it was the first
<BR>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
<BR>In dignity, and for the liberal arts
<BR>Without a parallel; those being all my study,
<BR>The government I cast upon my brother
<BR>And to my state grew stranger, being transported
<BR>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
<BR>Dost thou attend me?


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Sir, most heedfully.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Being once perfected how to grant suits,
<BR>How to deny them, who to advance and who
<BR>To trash for over-topping, new created
<BR>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
<BR>Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
<BR>Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
<BR>To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
<BR>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
<BR>And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>O, good sir, I do.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>I pray thee, mark me.
<BR>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
<BR>To closeness and the bettering of my mind
<BR>With that which, but by being so retired,
<BR>O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
<BR>Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
<BR>Like a good parent, did beget of him
<BR>A falsehood in its contrary as great
<BR>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
<BR>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
<BR>Not only with what my revenue yielded,
<BR>But what my power might else exact, like one
<BR>Who having into truth, by telling of it,
<BR>Made such a sinner of his memory,
<BR>To credit his own lie, he did believe
<BR>He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
<BR>And executing the outward face of royalty,
<BR>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
<BR>Dost thou hear?


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>To have no screen between this part he play'd
<BR>And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
<BR>Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
<BR>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
<BR>He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
<BR>So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
<BR>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
<BR>Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
<BR>The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
<BR>To most ignoble stooping.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>O the heavens!


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
<BR>If this might be a brother.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>I should sin
<BR>To think but nobly of my grandmother:
<BR>Good wombs have borne bad sons.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Now the condition.
<BR>The King of Naples, being an enemy
<BR>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
<BR>Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
<BR>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
<BR>Should presently extirpate me and mine
<BR>Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
<BR>With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
<BR>A treacherous army levied, one midnight
<BR>Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
<BR>The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
<BR>The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
<BR>Me and thy crying self.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Alack, for pity!
<BR>I, not remembering how I cried out then,
<BR>Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
<BR>That wrings mine eyes to't.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Hear a little further
<BR>And then I'll bring thee to the present business
<BR>Which now's upon's; without the which this story
<BR>Were most impertinent.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Wherefore did they not
<BR>That hour destroy us?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Well demanded, wench:
<BR>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
<BR>So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
<BR>A mark so bloody on the business, but
<BR>With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
<BR>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
<BR>Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
<BR>A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
<BR>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
<BR>Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
<BR>To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
<BR>To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
<BR>Did us but loving wrong.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Alack, what trouble
<BR>Was I then to you!


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>O, a cherubim
<BR>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
<BR>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
<BR>When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
<BR>Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
<BR>An undergoing stomach, to bear up
<BR>Against what should ensue.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>How came we ashore?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>By Providence divine.
<BR>Some food we had and some fresh water that
<BR>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
<BR>Out of his charity, being then appointed
<BR>Master of this design, did give us, with
<BR>Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
<BR>Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
<BR>Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
<BR>From mine own library with volumes that
<BR>I prize above my dukedom.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Would I might
<BR>But ever see that man!


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Now I arise:

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Resumes his mantle]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
<BR>Here in this island we arrived; and here
<BR>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
<BR>Than other princesses can that have more time
<BR>For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.


<tr valign=top><td>MIRANDA
<td>Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
<BR>For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
<BR>For raising this sea-storm?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Know thus far forth.
<BR>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
<BR>Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
<BR>Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
<BR>I find my zenith doth depend upon
<BR>A most auspicious star, whose influence
<BR>If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
<BR>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
<BR>Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
<BR>And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[MIRANDA sleeps]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
<BR>Approach, my Ariel, come.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ARIEL]


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
<BR>To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
<BR>To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
<BR>On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
<BR>Ariel and all his quality.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Hast thou, spirit,
<BR>Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>To every article.
<BR>I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
<BR>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
<BR>I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
<BR>And burn in many places; on the topmast,
<BR>The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
<BR>Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
<BR>O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
<BR>And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
<BR>Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
<BR>Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
<BR>Yea, his dread trident shake.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>My brave spirit!
<BR>Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
<BR>Would not infect his reason?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Not a soul
<BR>But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
<BR>Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
<BR>Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
<BR>Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
<BR>With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
<BR>Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
<BR>And all the devils are here.'


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Why that's my spirit!
<BR>But was not this nigh shore?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Close by, my master.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>But are they, Ariel, safe?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Not a hair perish'd;
<BR>On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
<BR>But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
<BR>In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
<BR>The king's son have I landed by himself;
<BR>Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
<BR>In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
<BR>His arms in this sad knot.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Of the king's ship
<BR>The mariners say how thou hast disposed
<BR>And all the rest o' the fleet.


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Safely in harbour
<BR>Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
<BR>Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
<BR>From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
<BR>The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
<BR>Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
<BR>I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
<BR>Which I dispersed, they all have met again
<BR>And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
<BR>Bound sadly home for Naples,
<BR>Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
<BR>And his great person perish.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Ariel, thy charge
<BR>Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
<BR>What is the time o' the day?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Past the mid season.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
<BR>Must by us both be spent most preciously.


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
<BR>Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
<BR>Which is not yet perform'd me.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>How now? moody?
<BR>What is't thou canst demand?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>My liberty.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Before the time be out? no more!


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>I prithee,
<BR>Remember I have done thee worthy service;
<BR>Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
<BR>Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
<BR>To bate me a full year.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Dost thou forget
<BR>From what a torment I did free thee?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>No.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
<BR>Of the salt deep,
<BR>To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
<BR>To do me business in the veins o' the earth
<BR>When it is baked with frost.


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>I do not, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
<BR>The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
<BR>Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>No, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Sir, in Argier.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>O, was she so? I must
<BR>Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
<BR>Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
<BR>For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
<BR>To enter human hearing, from Argier,
<BR>Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
<BR>They would not take her life. Is not this true?


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>Ay, sir.

<td>Be it so! Amen!

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain
<BR>amazedly following]

<tr valign=top><td><td>O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
<BR>I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
<BR>This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
<BR>That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
<BR>Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>The best news is, that we have safely found
<BR>Our king and company; the next, our ship--
<BR>Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
<BR>Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
<BR>We first put out to sea.


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service
<BR>Have I done since I went.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>These are not natural events; they strengthen
<BR>From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?


<tr valign=top><td>Boatswain
<td>If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
<BR>I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
<BR>And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
<BR>Where but even now with strange and several noises
<BR>Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
<BR>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
<BR>We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
<BR>Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
<BR>Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
<BR>Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
<BR>Even in a dream, were we divided from them
<BR>And were brought moping hither.


<tr valign=top><td>ARIEL
<td>[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
<BR>And there is in this business more than nature
<BR>Was ever conduct of: some oracle
<BR>Must rectify our knowledge.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Sir, my liege,
<BR>Do not infest your mind with beating on
<BR>The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
<BR>Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
<BR>Which to you shall seem probable, of every
<BR>These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
<BR>And think of each thing well.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside to ARIEL]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Come hither, spirit:
<BR>Set Caliban and his companions free;
<BR>Untie the spell.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit ARIEL]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How fares my gracious sir?
<BR>There are yet missing of your company
<BR>Some few odd lads that you remember not.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO
<BR>and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel]


<tr valign=top><td>STEPHANO
<td>Every man shift for all the rest, and
<BR>let no man take care for himself; for all is
<BR>but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!


<tr valign=top><td>TRINCULO
<td>If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
<BR>here's a goodly sight.


<tr valign=top><td>CALIBAN
<td>O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
<BR>How fine my master is! I am afraid
<BR>He will chastise me.


<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>Ha, ha!
<BR>What things are these, my lord Antonio?
<BR>Will money buy 'em?


<tr valign=top><td>ANTONIO
<td>Very like; one of them
<BR>Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
<BR>Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
<BR>His mother was a witch, and one so strong
<BR>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
<BR>And deal in her command without her power.
<BR>These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
<BR>For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
<BR>To take my life. Two of these fellows you
<BR>Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
<BR>Acknowledge mine.


<tr valign=top><td>CALIBAN
<td>I shall be pinch'd to death.


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?


<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>He is drunk now: where had he wine?


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
<BR>Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
<BR>How camest thou in this pickle?


<tr valign=top><td>TRINCULO
<td>I have been in such a pickle since I
<BR>saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
<BR>my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.


<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>Why, how now, Stephano!


<tr valign=top><td>STEPHANO
<td>O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?


<tr valign=top><td>STEPHANO
<td>I should have been a sore one then.


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Pointing to Caliban]


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>He is as disproportion'd in his manners
<BR>As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
<BR>Take with you your companions; as you look
<BR>To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.


<tr valign=top><td>CALIBAN
<td>Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
<BR>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
<BR>Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
<BR>And worship this dull fool!


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Go to; away!


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.


<tr valign=top><td>SEBASTIAN
<td>Or stole it, rather.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>Sir, I invite your highness and your train
<BR>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
<BR>For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
<BR>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
<BR>Go quick away; the story of my life
<BR>And the particular accidents gone by
<BR>Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
<BR>I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
<BR>Where I have hope to see the nuptial
<BR>Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
<BR>And thence retire me to my Milan, where
<BR>Every third thought shall be my grave.


<tr valign=top><td>ALONSO
<td>I long
<BR>To hear the story of your life, which must
<BR>Take the ear strangely.


<tr valign=top><td>PROSPERO
<td>I'll deliver all;
<BR>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
<BR>And sail so expeditious that shall catch
<BR>Your royal fleet far off.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Aside to ARIEL]

<tr valign=top><td><td>My Ariel, chick,
<BR>That is thy charge: then to the elements
<BR>Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt]





<tr valign=top><td><td>EPILOGUE


<tr valign=top><td><td>SPOKEN BY PROSPERO

<tr valign=top><td><td>Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
<BR>And what strength I have's mine own,
<BR>Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
<BR>I must be here confined by you,
<BR>Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
<BR>Since I have my dukedom got
<BR>And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
<BR>In this bare island by your spell;
<BR>But release me from my bands
<BR>With the help of your good hands:
<BR>Gentle breath of yours my sails
<BR>Must fill, or else my project fails,
<BR>Which was to please. Now I want
<BR>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
<BR>And my ending is despair,
<BR>Unless I be relieved by prayer,
<BR>Which pierces so that it assaults
<BR>Mercy itself and frees all faults.
<BR>As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
<BR>Let your indulgence set me free.
