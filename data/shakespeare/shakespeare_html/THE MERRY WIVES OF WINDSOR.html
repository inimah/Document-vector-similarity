<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW

<BR>Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER

<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW

<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
<BR>hundred years.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
<BR>all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
<BR>give the dozen white luces in their coat.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>It is an old coat.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
<BR>it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
<BR>man, and signifies love.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I may quarter, coz.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>You may, by marrying.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Not a whit.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
<BR>there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
<BR>simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
<BR>John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
<BR>you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
<BR>benevolence to make atonements and compremises
<BR>between you.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>The council shall bear it; it is a riot.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
<BR>fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
<BR>desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
<BR>riot; take your vizaments in that.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
<BR>should end it.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
<BR>and there is also another device in my prain, which
<BR>peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
<BR>is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
<BR>Page, which is pretty virginity.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
<BR>small like a woman.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS

<BR>and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
<BR>death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
<BR>--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
<BR>old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
<BR>and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
<BR>Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS

<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
<BR>despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
<BR>is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
<BR>beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
<BR>peat the door for Master Page.

<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW

<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
<BR>so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
<BR>hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
<BR>Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>Here comes Sir John.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL]


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
<BR>broke open my lodge.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>But not kissed your keeper's daughter?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
<BR>That is now answered.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>The council shall know this.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
<BR>you'll be laughed at.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
<BR>head: what matter have you against me?


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
<BR>and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
<BR>Nym, and Pistol.


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>You Banbury cheese!


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Ay, it is no matter.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>How now, Mephostophilus!


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Ay, it is no matter.


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
<BR>three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
<BR>is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
<BR>myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
<BR>lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>We three, to hear it and end it between them.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
<BR>book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
<BR>as great discreetly as we can.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Pistol!


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>He hears with ears.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
<BR>hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
<BR>never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
<BR>seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
<BR>shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
<BR>pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Is this true, Pistol?


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
<BR>I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
<BR>Word of denial in thy labras here!
<BR>Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>By these gloves, then, 'twas he.


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
<BR>'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
<BR>humour on me; that is the very note of it.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
<BR>though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
<BR>drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What say you, Scarlet and John?


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
<BR>himself out of his five sentences.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!


<tr valign=top><td>BARDOLPH
<td>And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
<BR>so conclusions passed the careires.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
<BR>matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
<BR>but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
<BR>if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
<BR>the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD
<BR>and MISTRESS PAGE, following]


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit ANNE PAGE]


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>How now, Mistress Ford!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
<BR>by your leave, good mistress.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Kisses her]


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
<BR>hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
<BR>we shall drink down all unkindness.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
<BR>Songs and Sonnets here.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter SIMPLE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
<BR>on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
<BR>about you, have you?


<tr valign=top><td>SIMPLE
<td>Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
<BR>Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
<BR>afore Michaelmas?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
<BR>you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
<BR>tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
<BR>here. Do you understand me?


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
<BR>I shall do that that is reason.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Nay, but understand me.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>So I do, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
<BR>description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
<BR>you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
<BR>country, simple though I stand here.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>But that is not the question: the question is
<BR>concerning your marriage.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ay, there's the point, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
<BR>reasonable demands.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
<BR>know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
<BR>philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
<BR>mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
<BR>good will to the maid?


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
<BR>would do reason.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
<BR>possitable, if you can carry her your desires
<BR>towards her.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
<BR>request, cousin, in any reason.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
<BR>is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
<BR>be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
<BR>decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
<BR>married and have more occasion to know one another;
<BR>I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
<BR>but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
<BR>I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.


<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS
<td>It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
<BR>the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
<BR>meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Ay, I think my cousin meant well.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW
<td>Here comes fair Mistress Anne.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Re-enter ANNE PAGE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE

<BR>worships' company.


<tr valign=top><td>SHALLOW

<tr valign=top><td>SIR HUGH EVANS

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS]


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE

<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER

<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE

<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
<BR>sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
<BR>cousin Shallow.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit SIMPLE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
<BR>friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
<BR>yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
<BR>live like a poor gentleman born.


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE
<td>I may not go in without your worship: they will not

<BR>though I did.


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE
<td>I pray you, sir, walk in.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
<BR>my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
<BR>dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
<BR>dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
<BR>abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
<BR>dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE
<td>I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
<BR>it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
<BR>the bear loose, are you not?


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE
<td>Ay, indeed, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>SLENDER
<td>That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
<BR>Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
<BR>the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
<BR>cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
<BR>indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
<BR>rough things.

<td>Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>Two yards, and more.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
<BR>yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
<BR>thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
<BR>wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
<BR>she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
<BR>can construe the action of her familiar style; and
<BR>the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
<BR>rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL

<td>Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
<BR>husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
<BR>another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
<BR>eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
<BR>oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
<BR>foot, sometimes my portly belly.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>Then did the sun on dunghill shine.


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>I thank thee for that humour.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
<BR>greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
<BR>seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
<BR>another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
<BR>is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
<BR>be cheater to them both, and they shall be
<BR>exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
<BR>Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
<BR>this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
<BR>Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
<BR>And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>I will run no base humour: here, take the
<BR>humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
<BR>Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
<BR>Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!
<BR>Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
<BR>French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN]


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
<BR>And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:
<BR>Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
<BR>Base Phrygian Turk!


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>I have operations which be humours of revenge.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>Wilt thou revenge?


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>By welkin and her star!


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>With wit or steel?


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>With both the humours, I:
<BR>I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.


<tr valign=top><td>PISTOL
<td>And I to Ford shall eke unfold
<BR>How Falstaff, varlet vile,
<BR>His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
<BR>And his soft couch defile.


<tr valign=top><td>NYM
<td>My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
<BR>deal with poison; I will possess him with
<BR>yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
<BR>that is my true humour.

<td>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS QUICKLY
<td>Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
<BR>have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
<BR>wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
<BR>court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
<BR>to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
<BR>lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
<BR>you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
<BR>after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
<BR>rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
<BR>such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
<BR>the best and the fairest, that would have won any
<BR>woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
<BR>get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
<BR>given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
<BR>any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
<BR>honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
<BR>her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
<BR>them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
<BR>is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
<BR>to notify that her husband will be absence from his

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Ten and eleven?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS QUICKLY
<td>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
<BR>picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
<BR>her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
<BR>woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
<BR>jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
<BR>him, good heart.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
<BR>not fail her.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS QUICKLY
<td>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
<BR>your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
<BR>commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
<BR>your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
<BR>one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
<BR>evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
<BR>other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
<BR>husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
<BR>will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
<BR>a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS QUICKLY
<td>That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
<BR>grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
<BR>Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
<BR>little page, of all loves: her husband has a
<BR>marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
<BR>Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
<BR>Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
<BR>she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
<BR>to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
<BR>she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
<BR>be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
<BR>send her your page; no remedy.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Why, I will.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS QUICKLY

<BR>go between you both; and in any case have a
<BR>nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
<BR>the boy never need to understand any thing; for
<BR>'tis not good that children should know any
<BR>wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
<BR>as they say, and know the world.

<BR>though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
<BR>myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
<BR>thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
<BR>own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
<BR>one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
<BR>turn another into the register of your own; that I
<BR>may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
<BR>yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Very well, sir; proceed.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
<BR>name is Ford.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Well, sir.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
<BR>bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
<BR>observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
<BR>fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
<BR>give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
<BR>to give her, but have given largely to many to know
<BR>what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
<BR>her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
<BR>wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
<BR>merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
<BR>I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
<BR>be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
<BR>rate, and that hath taught me to say this:

<tr valign=top><td><td>'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
<BR>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Never.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Have you importuned her to such a purpose?


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Never.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Of what quality was your love, then?


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
<BR>that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
<BR>where I erected it.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>When I have told you that, I have told you all.
<BR>Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
<BR>other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
<BR>there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
<BR>John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
<BR>gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
<BR>discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
<BR>place and person, generally allowed for your many
<BR>war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>O, sir!


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
<BR>it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
<BR>give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
<BR>to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
<BR>Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
<BR>consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
<BR>any.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
<BR>affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
<BR>Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
<BR>the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
<BR>soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
<BR>be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
<BR>with any detection in my hand, my desires had
<BR>instance and argument to commend themselves: I
<BR>could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
<BR>her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
<BR>other her defences, which now are too too strongly
<BR>embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
<BR>money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
<BR>gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>O good sir!


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I say you shall.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
<BR>none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
<BR>own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
<BR>assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
<BR>shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
<BR>that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
<BR>will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
<BR>know how I speed.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
<BR>sir?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
<BR>yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
<BR>jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
<BR>which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
<BR>use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
<BR>and there's my harvest-home.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
<BR>if you saw him.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
<BR>stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
<BR>cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
<BR>cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
<BR>will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
<BR>lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
<BR>Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
<BR>thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
<BR>cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
<BR>ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
<BR>improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
<BR>hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
<BR>have thought this? See the hell of having a false
<BR>woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
<BR>ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
<BR>only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
<BR>the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
<BR>does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
<BR>well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
<BR>devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
<BR>Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
<BR>not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
<BR>will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
<BR>rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
<BR>the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
<BR>aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
<BR>gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
<BR>then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
<BR>think in their hearts they may effect, they will
<BR>break their hearts but they will effect. God be
<BR>praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
<BR>I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
<BR>Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
<BR>better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
<BR>Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

<BR>encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
<BR>and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
<BR>and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
<BR>provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
<BR>forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<BR>distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have

<BR>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's

<BR>mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
<BR>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
<BR>the jealous knave their master in the door, who
<BR>asked them once or twice what they had in their
<BR>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
<BR>would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
<BR>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
<BR>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
<BR>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
<BR>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
<BR>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
<BR>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
<BR>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
<BR>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
<BR>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
<BR>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
<BR>man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
<BR>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
<BR>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
<BR>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
<BR>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
<BR>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
<BR>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
<BR>that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.

<td>Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD
<td>Why?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
<BR>he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
<BR>against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
<BR>daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
<BR>himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
<BR>out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
<BR>tameness, civility and patience, to this his
<BR>distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD
<td>Why, does he talk of him?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
<BR>last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
<BR>to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
<BR>the rest of their company from their sport, to make
<BR>another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
<BR>the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD
<td>How near is he, Mistress Page?

<td>Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD

<BR>with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
<BR>you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD
<td>There they always use to discharge their

<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Where is it?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD
<td>He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
<BR>coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
<BR>abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
<BR>goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF

<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
<BR>big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
<BR>a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
<BR>than a mischief.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS FORD
<td>My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a

<BR>they did last time.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him

<BR>now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]


<tr valign=top><td>DOCTOR CAIUS
<td>Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
<BR>married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
<BR>it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Why, did you take her in green?


<tr valign=top><td>DOCTOR CAIUS
<td>Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Exit]


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.

<tr valign=top><td><td>[Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]

<tr valign=top><td><td>How now, Master Fenton!


<tr valign=top><td>ANNE PAGE
<td>Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Why went you not with master doctor, maid?


<tr valign=top><td>FENTON
<td>You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
<BR>You would have married her most shamefully,
<BR>Where there was no proportion held in love.
<BR>The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
<BR>Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
<BR>The offence is holy that she hath committed;
<BR>And this deceit loses the name of craft,
<BR>Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
<BR>Since therein she doth evitate and shun
<BR>A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
<BR>Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
<BR>In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
<BR>Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
<BR>strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.


<tr valign=top><td>PAGE
<td>Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
<BR>What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.


<tr valign=top><td>FALSTAFF
<td>When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.


<tr valign=top><td>MISTRESS PAGE
<td>Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
<BR>Heaven give you many, many merry days!
<BR>Good husband, let us every one go home,
<BR>And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
<BR>Sir John and all.


<tr valign=top><td>FORD
<td>Let it be so. Sir John,
<BR>To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
<BR>For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
